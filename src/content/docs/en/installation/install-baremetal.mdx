The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS as baremetal by covering all the possible choices you could set.

## Pre-installation

In case you are installing Athena OS in dual boot with Windows, make sure that **Fast Startup** is disabled. For doing that on Windows, open **Control Panel** -> **Hardware and Sound** -> **Power Options** -> click on **Choose what the power buttons do** on the left side -> click on **Change Settings that are currently unavailable** on top (This will ask for administrator permissions) -> Unselect the **Turn on fast startup** option and click on **Save Changes** button.

Furthermore, you need to preserve the Microsoft bootloader files. We need to face the following scenario:
* Format the existing boot partition: save Microsoft bootloader folder somewhere, format the boot partitition, and move Microsoft bootloader folder inside it.

{/*
Don't format the existing boot partition: just remove possible conflicting files before running the installation.
*/}

#### Save Microsoft bootloader

If you will format the boot partition, you need to save Microsoft bootloader files.
Once you land on the Live Environment, open terminal and mount your existing boot partition (i.e., `/dev/nvme0n1p1`) containing Microsoft bootloader:
```shell
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt
cp -rf /mnt/EFI/Microsoft ~/
sudo umount /mnt
```
it will save `Microsoft` folder in the `liveuser` home folder. We will restore it just after the Athena OS installation ends as explained later.

{/*
#### Remove conflicting files

If you won't format the existing boot partition, some existing files could conflict with the system installation.
Before running it, once you land on the Live Environment, open terminal and mount your existing boot partition (i.e., `/dev/nvme0n1p1`) and let's remove them:
```shell
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt
sudo rm -rf /mnt/memtest86+ /mnt/syslinux /mnt/*-ucode.img /mnt/grub/themes/athena*
sudo umount /mnt
```
*/}

## Install Athena OS

Once prepared the setup as described in [Baremetal installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-install/#prepare-baremetal-installation), and rebooted the system with your plugged USB drive containing the Athena OS installation media, you will see:
