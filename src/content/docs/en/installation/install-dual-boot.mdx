The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS as dual booth with Linux or Windows by covering all the possible choices you could set.

## Windows pre-settings

In case you are installing Athena OS in dual boot with Windows, make sure that **Fast Startup** is disabled. For doing that on Windows, open **Control Panel** -> **Hardware and Sound** -> **Power Options** -> click on **Choose what the power buttons do** on the left side -> click on **Change Settings that are currently unavailable** on top (This will ask for administrator permissions) -> Unselect the **Turn on fast startup** option and click on **Save Changes** button.

## Install Athena OS as dual boot

Once prepared the setup as described in [Baremetal installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-baremetal/), and rebooted the system with your plugged USB drive containing the Athena OS installation media, according to your boot mode (EFI or BIOS/Legacy), you will be shown:

![EFI Boot](@assets/images/efi-boot.png)

for **EFI boot**, select **Athena OS install medium** or:

![BIOS/Legacy Boot](@assets/images/bios-boot.png)

for **BIOS/Legacy boot**, select **Boot Athena OS (x86_64, BIOS, open source)**.

Once you land on the Live Environment, follow the [Calamares Installer](/en/configuration/calamares/) chapter until the **Partitions** section.

## Partitioning

You can install Athena OS by three methods for dual boot: Install alongside, Replace a partition, Manual partitioning.

Note that currently, the default file system that will be set for *Install alongside* and *Replace a partition* methods is BTRFS. BTRFS provides several interesting features as **snapshots** in order to rollback your system in case of fault. For changing default file system, you need to edit `/etc/calamares/modules/partition.conf` and replace the `btrfs` value with one of the available file systems. The value must be replaced in the line containing:
```
defaultFileSystemType:  "btrfs"
```
The available file systems are defined in the same file.

### Install alongside

![Install alongside](@assets/images/calamares-partition-alongside.png)

Look on the part with **Current** bar, select the Linux or Windows partition on the related colored bar and drag it until you get the needed disk space for Athena OS.

Select **Encrypt system** checkbox if you wish to encrypt your partition.
:::caution
Note that also `/boot` partition used by GRUB will be encrypted. The default GRUB image file supports only en_US keyboard layout, so, if the user sets a different keyboard layout during the installation, the decryption prompt will still work by en_US keyboard layout. If you want to avoid this, you must go for [Manual Partitioning](/en/installation/install-dual-boot/#Manual partitioning).

Click **Next** and proceed to the installation.

### Replace a partition

If you don't like the first method, you can choose to create a partition by GParted.

Once you land on the Live Environment, Athena Welcome will be shown. Click on **Run GParted** button for setting your disk. Depending on your existing setup, the disk structure could consist of:
* Dedicated partitions for specified directories (i.e., `/home`, `/tmp` and `/var`)
* Swap partition

Let's guess you have an existing Linux or Windows OS on your endpoint. We need to use the free space of this existing partition to the one we will use for Athena OS.

![GParted](@assets/images/gparted.png)

On GParted, on top-right select the disk to work on. Then, right-click on the existing Linux or Windows partition to shrink for getting our empty space (if we don't already have a disk space to use), click on **Resize/Move** and set the available space we need on **New size (MiB)** field:

![GParted Resize](@assets/images/gparted-resize.png)

*Note: the size is measured in **MiB** by default and, when you fill **New size (MiB)** field, the other fields are automatically filled. You can also resize the partition by moving the slider on the top part of the window.*

Click **Resize** button. Once resized your Linux or Windows partition, click **Apply All Operations** icon for applying these changes on your disk.

![GParted Apply](@assets/images/gparted-apply.png)

On the appearing popup window, click on **Apply**.

Go back to Athena Welcome, and select `Offline Install` or `Online Install`, reach the **Partitions** section, check **Replace a partition** and on the **Current** bar, click on the colored partition where you want to install Athena OS.

![Replace a partition](@assets/images/calamares-partition-replace.png)

Select **Encrypt system** checkbox if you wish to encrypt your partition.
:::caution
Note that also `/boot` partition used by GRUB will be encrypted. The default GRUB image file supports only en_US keyboard layout, so, if the user sets a different keyboard layout during the installation, the decryption prompt will still work by en_US keyboard layout. If you want to avoid this, you must go for [Manual Partitioning](/en/installation/install-dual-boot/#manual-partitioning).
:::

Click **Next** and proceed to the installation.

### Manual partitioning

![Manual partitioning](@assets/images/calamares-partition-manual.png)

You should:
* click on **New Partition Table** and select **GUID Partition Table**
* BIOS-GRUB. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 8 MB
  * File System: unformatted
  * Flags: bios-grub
  * Click OK
* Boot partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 300 MB
  * File System: ext4 or fat32
  * Mount Point: /boot
  * Flags: boot (or boot-efi)
  * Click OK
* Data partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: the remaining size
  * File System: btrfs (or any file system you wish)
  * Encrypt: select it if you want to encrypt your data partition
  * Mount Point: /
  * Click OK

You should have something like:
![Manual Partitioning](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-iso/assets/83867734/26a729f2-ad8b-4dc7-b7af-9012b7e50464)

or, for encrypted data partition, like

![Manual Partitioning Encryption](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-iso/assets/83867734/af97b518-c1ad-4716-b83f-d73f57112b96)

Then click **Next**. You will get some warning messages, just click **OK** and run the installation.

:::caution
Note that we don't create a SWAP space because Athena OS uses [ZRAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram). In case you perform a custom configuration where you remove ZRAM and use ZSWAP, you can create the SWAP partition as above by setting:
* Swap Space if you wish to have it. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then
  * Size: set a suitable size for Swap Space if you would like to set it (it should be a power of 2)
  * File System: linuxswap
  * Flags: swap
  * Click OK
