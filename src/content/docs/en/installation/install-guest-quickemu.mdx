[Quickemu](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu) is a wrapper for the excellent QEMU that automatically "does the right thing" when creating virtual machines. No requirement for exhaustive configuration options. You decide what operating system you want to run and Quickemu takes care of the rest:
* `quickget` automatically downloads the upstream OS and creates the configuration;
* `quickemu` enumerates your hardware and launches the virtual machine with the optimum configuration best suited to your computer.

You can install Quickemu in your host as described in the [official documentation](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/wiki/01-Installation).
:::note
If you are installing `quickemu` on an Arch-based machine, install `qemu-desktop` or `qemu-full` as dependency.
:::

Once Quickemu is installed, there are two simple steps to create and run Athena OS:
* **quickget** automatically downloads the ISO image for Athena OS and creates a configuration file for the virtual machine:
  ```shell
  quickget athenaos v23.11
  ```
* **quickemu** starts the virtual machine using the configuration file created by `quickget`:
  ```shell
  quickemu --vm athenaos-v23.11.conf
  ```
:::tip
If your host is a Linux or MacOS virtual machine, you need nested virtualization by **Intel VT-x/EPT** or **AMD-V/RVI**. To enable it, be sure that virtualization is enabled on your BIOS. If this Linux or MacOS virtual machine where to install Quickemu is running on a Windows host, disable Hyper-V by searching and opening *Turn Windows features on and off* and uncheck *Hyper-V* entry. Open CMD as Administrator and run:
```shell
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```
Then, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
```
Finally, reboot.
Successively, you need to enable nested virtualization on your virtualization software. Go to your Virtual Machine software settings:
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="VMware Workstation">
*Hardware* tab -> *Processors* -> check *Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI*.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Oracle VirtualBox">
*System* tab -> *Processor* tab -> check *Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V*.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
Now `quickemu` machine can be virtualized inside your virtual machine.
