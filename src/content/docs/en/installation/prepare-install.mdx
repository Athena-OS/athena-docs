The following section will guide you through the steps to prepare all the elements for installing Athena OS.

## System Requirements

Athena OS is currently supported on amd64 (x86_64/64-bit) platforms and can be installed as **Athena Arch** (Arch-based system) or **Athena Nix** (NixOS-based system).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Athena Arch">
The minimum requirements are:
* 20GB hard disk space for installation.
* 2GB RAM.
* A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.

The recommended hardware specification for a smooth experience are:
* 50 GB of hard disk space, SSD preferred.
* At least 4GB of RAM.
* At least 2 cores.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Athena Nix">
The minimum requirements are:
* 30GB hard disk space for installation.
* 4GB RAM + 4GB of swap partition.
* A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.

The recommended hardware specification for a smooth experience are:
* 50 GB of hard disk space, SSD preferred.
* At least 8GB of RAM.
* At least 2 cores.

:::tip
During Athena Nix install, if the system freezes for some minutes (just look the frozen system clock), try to increase resources, for example assign more swap space.
:::

:::tip
To install Athena Nix with lower resources, just follow [Installing by NixOS](/en/installation/install-nixos/) guide. This method allows you to install first vanilla NixOS, and after system installation, install Athena Nix over it.

## Preparing for the Installation

Before installing Athena OS on your endpoint, you need a set of tasks to prepare.

## Download the Image

Download Athena OS as described in [Downloading Athena OS](/en/getting-started/download/) chapter.

## Prepare Baremetal Installation

### Creating a Bootable Athena USB drive

You can use several software for creating a bootable Athena USB drive on Linux or Windows. The USB drive must be atleast 4 GB of size.

#### Creating a Bootable USB drive on Linux

##### Balena Etcher

1. Plug your USB drive into your available USB port.
2. Download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/). If you download the `.AppImage` file, assign executable permission by `chmod +x balenaEtcher-<version>-<arch>.AppImage` and run it by `./balenaEtcher-<version>-<arch>.AppImage`.
3. Click **Flash from file** and select the Athena ISO image file.
4. Click **Select target** and choose the label of your plugged USB drive.
5. Click **Flash** for starting the process. 
   :::note
   You could be asked for administration privileges, so insert credentials and press **Authenticate**.
   :::

At the end of flash process you will get a **Flash Completed!** message. Close Balena Etcher and reboot the system for booting into Athena OS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.
:::

##### Command Line Interface

1. Plug your USB drive into your available USB port.
2. Detect the drive device label of the plugged USB drive by `sudo fdisk -l` (i.e., it could be `/dev/sdX` where `X` is `a`, `b`, and so on).
3. Run `sudo dd bs=4M if=athena-<file-version>-<arch>.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync` (replace `/dev/sdX` by the drive device label of your plugged USB drive).

`dd` command` will now copy the contents of the ISO file over to your USB driive. Once done, youâ€™re ready to use the USB drive as Athena OS installation media. Reboot the system for booting into Athena OS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.

#### Creating a Bootable USB drive on Windows

##### Balena Etcher

1. Plug your USB drive into your available USB port.
2. Download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) and install it, or run the portable version.
3. Click **Flash from file** and select the Athena ISO image file.
4. Click **Select target** and choose the label of your plugged USB drive.
5. Click **Flash** for starting the process.
   :::note
   You could be asked for administration privileges, so insert credentials and press **Authenticate**.
   :::

At the end of flash process you will get a **Flash Completed!** message. Close Balena Etcher and reboot the system for booting into Athena OS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.
:::

##### Rufus

1. Plug your USB drive into your available USB port.
2. Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and install it, or run the portable version.
3. On **Device**, click on the dropdown list and select your plugged USB drive.
4. On **Boot selection**, click on **SELECT** and locate the Athena ISO image file.
5. Click **START**.

6. When the **ISOHybrid image detected** window appears, select what you wish. DD Image mode provides more compatibility and it should be used in case of issues during boot.

![Balena Etcher](@assets/images/windows-rufus-confirm.png)

At the end of flash process you will get **READY** status. Close Rufus and reboot the system for booting into Athena OS.
:::note
Be sure to have the USB drive **boot priority** over other drives in the BIOS.
