This chapter explains how to virtualize Athena OS inside of VMware in order to run Athena OS as virtual machine. This approach could be useful in case you would like to have a separated machine from the host that could also interact with other virtual machines, the host itself and other endpoints on the local network.

:::caution
In order to use a virtual machine, make sure to enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI.

For this guide, VMware Workstation on Linux has been used, but the steps are the same for Windows.

Once you downloaded and installed VMware Workstation, open it and click on **Create a New Virtual Machine**

Then, you can set the same choices that you see on the next images or you can tweak some option you wish

When you finished to set this initial configuration, we need to tweak some settings.

For first, click on **Edit virtual machine settings** and then click on **Printer** and click on **Remove**

Then you can set the USB as you wish, for example

It is suggested on VMware to enable 3D Acceleration and assign some GB on it as the following

Enable the **Report battery information to guests**

It could be useful to enable **Shared Folders** if you need to exchange files between the virtual machine and the host

Finally you can set also the **Synchronize guest time with host** option

Save changes and run the virtual machine and install Athena OS as explained in [Installing as single boot](/en/installation/installing-single-boot/).

*Note: Athena OS automatically recognizes if you are using a virtualized environment so you don't need to install VMware Tools because the system will do automatically for you during the OS installation.*
