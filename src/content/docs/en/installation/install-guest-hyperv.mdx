**Hyper-V** is a hypervisor that is included with some versions of Microsoft Windows. For using Athena OS as guest in Hyper-V, you need to [enable it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).

After enabling Hyper-V, on Windows search and open **Hyper-V Manager** and, on the left pane, click on the resource with the name of our host

Click on **Quick Create...** on the right pane. A window will popup. Click on **Location installation source** button and on **Change installation source...** button for loading Athena OS ISO image file, uncheck **This virtual machine will run Windows**, and on the bottom-right side, expand **More options** and type the name of the VM and click on **Create Virtual Machine**

Once finished, you should get the following window

Click on **Edit settings...** and you can tweak the options you wish, for example move to **Processor** tab and set the **Number of virtual processors** to 2

Then, move to **Integration Services** and enable **Guest services**

When you set all your favourite settings, click on **Apply** button and then **OK**. You can now click on **Connect** and finally on **Start**

The virtual machine will run with a 1024x768 resolution. For changing it, go to Athena OS settings -> Display and change it to your favourite resolution

For further configuration or tricks, read the [Arch Linux Hyper-V documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyper-V).

Once booted, install Athena OS as explained in [Installing as single boot](/en/installation/install-single-boot/) chapter.
:::note
Athena OS automatically recognizes if you are using a virtualized environment so you don't need to install Hyper-V Guest Tools because the system will do automatically for you during the OS installation.
