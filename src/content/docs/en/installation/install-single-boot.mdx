The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS as baremetal by covering all the possible choices you could set.

## Install Athena OS as single boot

Once prepared the setup as described in [Installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-install/), and rebooted the system with your plugged USB drive containing the Athena OS installation media, according to your boot mode (EFI or BIOS/Legacy), you will be shown:

for **EFI boot**, select **Athena OS install medium** or:

![BIOS/Legacy Boot](@assets/images/bios-boot.png)

for **BIOS/Legacy boot**, select **Boot Athena OS (x86_64, BIOS, open source)**.

Once you land on the Live Environment, in case your Internet connection is restricted, please use a VPN service. To set a VPN, click on the network icon on the top bar and select *VPN Connection* -> *Add a VPN connection...*:

Finally, confirm the partitioning setting you chose

### Calamares
On **Partitions** section, select **Erase disk**. You can choose your favourite **File System** between:
* [BTRFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/btrfs)
* [Ext4](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ext4)
* [F2F2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/F2FS)
* [JFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/JFS)
* [Reiser](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Reiser4)
* [XFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XFS)

![Erase disk](@assets/images/calamares-partition-erase.png)
:::caution
**Erase disk** will delete ALL operating systems you previously installed on your endpoint.
:::

Select **Encrypt system** checkbox if you wish to encrypt your partition.
:::caution
Also `/boot` partition used by GRUB will be encrypted. The default GRUB image file supports only **en_US** keyboard layout, so, if the user sets a different keyboard layout during the installation, the decryption prompt will still work by **en_US** keyboard layout. If you want to avoid this, you must go for [Manual Partitioning](/en/installation/install-dual-boot/#Manual partitioning).
:::
Click **Next** and proceed to the installation.
