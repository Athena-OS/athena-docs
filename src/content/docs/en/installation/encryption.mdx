Athena OS supports **LUKS encryption** for full-disk or root partition encryption with TPM 2.0.  
Optionally, in Athena Arch, the encryption key can be automatically **stored and managed by the TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**, providing secure key handling without requiring you to manually type a passphrase on every boot.

This integration is handled automatically by **Aegis Installer**, which can detect your TPM device and configure LUKS to unlock the encrypted partition using the TPM key at boot time.

By integrating LUKS with TPM, Athena OS ensures a high level of data protection while maintaining usability and system integrity.

## How It Works

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) provides strong disk encryption by securing your partitions with AES-based cryptography.

When combined with TPM, the decryption key is securely sealed within the TPM hardware and can be unsealed only under the same platform configuration (PCR values).

In practice:

1. The partition (usually `/`) is encrypted with LUKS.
2. A keyslot is added to LUKS that uses a TPM-stored key.
3. At boot, **systemd-cryptsetup** (or **clevis**) retrieves the key from the TPM to unlock the partition automatically.

This ensures that:
- Your encryption key never leaves the TPM chip.
- The system can auto-unlock without manual password entry (optional).
- The disk remains unreadable if removed or the platform changes significantly.

## Setup During Installation

During installation with **Aegis**, you can choose to:
- **Encrypt ROOT (LUKS)** - a passphrase is requested.
- **Bind the key to TPM** - if TPM is detected, Aegis will store the decryption key securely in the TPM and configure automatic unlocking.

:::tip
If the TPM option is not available, the set passphrase will be prompted at each boot for decrypting the encrypted partition.

## Post-installation Management

You can manage TPM-bound LUKS keys using `systemd-cryptenroll` or `clevis`.  
For example:

```shell
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

This command will create a TPM2-bound keyslot for the encrypted partition `/dev/nvme0n1p3`.
If the TPM is cleared or replaced, this keyslot becomes invalid, hence why backups or recovery passphrases are essential.

To verify TPM enrollment:
```shell
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --list /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

:::caution
Don't lose your passphrase. If PCR values change because of malicious tampering on your system, at boot you will be asked to type your passphrase to decrypt the encrypted partition. Store it securely.

## Platform Configuration Registers

**PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers)** are small memory registers inside the TPM that store cryptographic measurements of critical system components taken during boot.
Each PCR represents a stage of the boot process, from firmware and bootloader to kernel and Secure Boot data.
These measurements ensure that the TPM will only release the LUKS decryption key if the system's boot components match the same trusted state recorded during enrollment.

**What happens when PCRs change?**

Athena OS uses PCR7, PCR9, PCR11, PCR14 registries. During each boot, Athena OS measures firmware, bootloader, and kernel components into TPM registers (PCRs). If the current measurements match those taken when the LUKS key was enrolled, the TPM releases the key automatically. If they differ, for example, after firmware or kernel updates, or potential tampering on kernel, firmware or bootloader, the TPM refuses to unseal the key. In that case, you'll be prompted to enter your LUKS passphrase manually. Once booted, you can safely re-enroll the TPM keyslot to reflect the new measurements.

## Important Warnings for Dual Boot with Windows

If you are dual booting with Windows that uses BitLocker, be extremely careful.

BitLocker also stores its encryption keys in the same TPM chip.
:::danger
If you clear or wipe the TPM from Linux, you will erase all keys stored in it, including the BitLocker key, making your Windows drive inaccessible.
If you clear or reset the TPM from Linux, and you don't have your BitLocker recovery key, you will lose access to your Windows installation.
:::

Before performing any TPM operations from Linux:

1. Backup your BitLocker recovery key.
   You can find it in your Microsoft Account â†’ https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey

2. Suspend BitLocker protection from Windows before manipulating TPM.
   ```powershell
   manage-bde -protectors -disable C:
   ```

3. After operations are done, re-enable protection:
   ```powershell
   manage-bde -protectors -enable C:
   ```

If you previously used BitLocker and reinstalled Athena on the same system, it is highly recommended to clear TPM only after backing up all Windows recovery keys.

## Recovery Tips

If you lose TPM access or reinstall your firmware, your TPM keyslot will no longer unlock your LUKS partition automatically, and you will be asked to manually enter the LUKS passphrase.
You can unlock it using your manual passphrase entered during Athena OS installation.

Once ologged on the system, you can re-enroll a new TPM keyslot by executing:
```shell
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7+9+11+14 /dev/nvme0n1p3
```
and entering the LUKS passphrase.
