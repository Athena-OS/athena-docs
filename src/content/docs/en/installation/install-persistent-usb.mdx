The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS in a persistent USB by covering all the possible choices you could set.

Before starting, you need two USB drives:
* **USB-1**: for creating bootable media
* **USB-2**: on which persistent Athena OS will be installed

Burn Athena OS ISO on USB-1 as described in the [Installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-install/) guide.

After that, reboot the system while keeping USB-1 plugged in your USB port and you will be shown:

![EFI Boot](@assets/images/efi-boot.png)

and select **Athena OS install medium**.

Once you land on the Live Environment, attach USB-2 to a different USB port and be sure it is working, and follow the [System Installation](/en/installation/install-baremetal/) documentation.

:::danger
By installing the system in a persistent USB, the bootloader installed on the hard disk could be deleted and you would need to reinstall it.
:::

### Post-installation

In case the bootloader is broken, you must repair it.
