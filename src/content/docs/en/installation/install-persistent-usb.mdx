import ImageComponent from "@components/ImageComponent.astro";
import ThemedImage from '@components/ThemedImage.astro';

The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS in a persistent USB by covering all the possible choices you could set.

Before starting, you need two USB drives:
* **USB-1**: for creating bootable media
* **USB-2**: on which persistent Athena OS will be installed

Burn Athena OS ISO on USB-1 as described in the [Baremetal installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-baremetal/) guide.

After that, reboot the system while keeping USB-1 plugged in your USB port and, according to your boot mode (EFI or BIOS/Legacy), you will be shown:

![EFI Boot](@assets/images/efi-boot.png)

for **EFI boot**, select **Athena OS install medium** or:

![BIOS/Legacy Boot](@assets/images/bios-boot.png)

for **BIOS/Legacy boot**, select **Boot Athena OS (x86_64, BIOS, open source)**.

Once you land on the Live Environment, attach USB-2 to a different USB port and be sure it is working, and follow the [Calamares Installer](/en/configuration/calamares/) chapter until the **Partitions** section.

## Partitioning

On **Partitions** section, on **Select storage device** dropdown menu at top side, select the name of your USB-2 device and select **Manual Partitioning**.

You should:
* click on **New Partition Table** and select **GUID Partition Table**
* BIOS-GRUB. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 8 MB
  * File System: unformatted
  * Flags: bios-grub
  * Click OK
* Boot partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 300 MB
  * File System: ext4 or fat32
  * Mount Point: /boot
  * Flags: boot (or boot-efi)
  * Click OK
* Data partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: the remaining size
  * File System: btrfs (or any file system you wish)
  * Encrypt: select it if you want to encrypt your data partition
  * Mount Point: /
  * Click OK

You should have something like:
![USB Manual Partitioning](@assets/images/calamares-partition-usb.png)

or, for encrypted data partition, like

![USB Manual Partitioning Encryption](@assets/images/calamares-partition-usb-encrypted.png)

Then click **Next**. You will get some warning messages, just click **OK** and run the installation.

:::note
We don't create a SWAP space because Athena OS uses [ZRAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram).
:::

:::tip
If you would like to disable ZRAM and use ZSWAP, you can create the SWAP partition by:
* clicking on **Free Space** and clicking on **Create** then
  * Size: set a suitable size for Swap Space if you would like to set it (it should be a power of 2)
  * File System: linuxswap
  * Flags: swap
  * Click OK

After the OS installation, disable ZRAM by running:
```
swapoff /dev/zram0
modprobe -r zram
echo 1 > /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled
```
and enable ZSWAP by removing `zswap.enabled=0` from **/etc/default/grub** inside **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT** variable and running:
```
update-grub
```
or
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
Reboot your system. Finally, verify if the ZSWAP as been set correctly by running:
```
swapon -s
```
and check if the output corresponds to your swap partition.
:::

:::danger
By installing the system in a persistent USB, the GRUB installed on the hard disk could be deleted and you would need to reinstall it.
:::

### Post-installation
For fixing the GRUB, before exiting from the Live Environment, before proceeding, you must detect the existing Linux partition and the EFI partition containing the GRUB entries for Linux and Windows (or other OS). You can do that by running `sudo fdisk -l`.

Let's guess the existing Linux partition is `/dev/sda3` and the boot efi partition is at `/dev/nvme0n1p1`.

If your existing Linux distribution is based on BTRFS file system, run:
```
sudo mount -o subvol=@ /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount -o subvol=@home /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount -o subvol=@log /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
otherwise run:
```
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
Then, run:
```
mkdir /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount --bind /tmp/intermediate /mnt/boot/efi/

sudo arch-chroot /mnt
```
Now, check the directory tree in `/boot/efi` folder and you should have only these files/directories:
```
'$RECYCLE.BIN'  EFI  'System Volume Information'
```
Check the `EFI`directory and **be sure** that there are not nested further `EFI` directories otherwise your GRUB never work. You must have only the current `EFI` directory with the following files/directories:
```
Boot Microsoft
```
If you see also another `EFI` directory or other ones containing the file `grubx64.efi` (i.e., `GRUB` directory), delete these folders. Note that in other distros, `GRUB` folder could have a different name. Don't worry to delete `GRUB`folder, the next command will create it again.

Then run:
```
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
```
This command will create the file `/boot/efi/EFI/GRUB/grubx64.efi`.

Finally:
```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
at reboot, be sure that on BIOS the **GRUB** entry has the first priority over Windows Boot Manager. Then, it should work.

:::danger
Don't remove any other files or folders on mounted directories otherwise they will be deleted also on the related device and the boot manager could break.
:::

In case you previously formatted your EFI partition, its UUID could be changed, so, at this point, when you boot, you could get an error and be dropped on the emergency shell:
```
[ TIME ] Timed out waiting for device /dev/disk/by-uuid/0EBF-C0AD.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for File System Check on /dev/disk/by-uuid/0EBF-C0AD.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for /boot/efi
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems.
You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type "journalctl -xb" to view system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, or "exit" to continue bootup.
Give root password for maintenance
```
To fix this, boot again by USB to the Athena OS Live Environment and mounting the devices as done before, like:
If your existing Linux distribution is based on BTRFS file system, run:
```
sudo mount -o subvol=@ /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount -o subvol=@home /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount -o subvol=@log /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
otherwise run:
```
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
Then, run:
```
mkdir /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount --bind /tmp/intermediate /mnt/boot/efi/

sudo arch-chroot /mnt
```
Once you are on chroot environment, run:
```
sudo blkid /dev/nvme0n1p1
```
replace `/dev/nvme0n1p1` by your EFI partition device. This command gives you the valid UUID of your EFI partition, for example:
```
/dev/nvme0n1p1: UUID="E856-25BA" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTLABEL="EFI system partition" PARTUUID="71e827d6-2276-46f2-816b-881e51c53d30"
```
Then, you must edit **fstab** to replace the old EFI UUID with this new one. So, open the **fstab** file by:
```
nano /etc/fstab
```
and you should get something similar to:
```
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system>             <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
UUID=0EBF-C0AD                            /boot/efi      vfat    umask=0077 0 2
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /              btrfs   subvol=/@,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /home          btrfs   subvol=/@home,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /var/cache     btrfs   subvol=/@cache,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /var/log       btrfs   subvol=/@log,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
```
Replace the **UUID** value of the line containing `/boot/efi` with the one obtained by the `sudo blkid` command above. Save the file, exit from chroot environment by `exit` command, and reboot the system. Again, at reboot, be sure that on BIOS the **GRUB** entry has the first priority over Windows Boot Manager. Then, it should work.

Once landed on your working and fixed Linux environment, open the terminal and run:
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
to restore the Windows entry in GRUB in case it is missing. Reboot the system to check all GRUB entries are working as intended.

## Restore Linux and Windows EFI Boot

In case you broke the EFI partition containing Linux and Windows EFI Boot files (assuming they were on the same partition), download a Windows ISO and burn it on a USB key. Then, boot up it. When you reach the Windows installation environment:
1. select your language and keyboard layout
2. click on **Repair your computer** button
3. click on **Troubleshooting**
4. click on **Command Prompt**
5. run **diskpart**
:::danger
Don't run `CLEAN` command in **DISKPART** otherwise it will soft delete the selected disk! If it occurs, you must recover it by **testdisk** Linux tool.
:::
6. run **list disk** and identify the disk number of the disk containing the Windows EFI Boot partition
7. run **sel disk \<number\>** where *\<number\>* must be replaced with the number of the interested disk
8. run **list part** and identify the partition number of the partition of the selected disk containing the Windows EFI Boot. Usually it is tagged as **System** and it has small size
9. run **sel part \<number\>** where *\<number\>* must be replaced with the number of the interested partition
10. run **delete partition override** to delete the current broken EFI partition
11. run **create part efi size=100** for creating a new EFI partition (the size must be at least 100 MB)
    If you get an error stating:
    ```
    MSR and EFI are Only Supported on the GPT Disk.
    ```
    it means that the disk where you are creating the EFI disk is not GPT. If it is already GPT type, skip to the next step. If not, you need to make it GPT type as follows. Boot on Linux Live Environment by a USB pendrive and use **testdisk** tool. Open the terminal and run:
   ```
   testdisk
   ```
   Choose if logging or not. Then select the disk where you will restore the EFI partition:
   ```
   Select a media (use Arrow keys, then press Enter):
    Disk /dev/sda - 1000 GB / 931 GiB - ST1000LM049-2GH172

    Disk /dev/loop0 - 2849 MB / 2717 MiB (RO)
   >Disk /dev/nvme0n1 - 256 GB / 238 GiB
   ```
   Then select **EFI GPT**:
   ```
   Disk /dev/nvme0n1 - 256 GB / 238 GiB

   Please select the partition table type, press Enter when done.

   Structure: Ok.  Use Up/Down Arrow keys to select partition.
   Use Left/Right Arrow keys to CHANGE partition characteristics:
                   P=Primary  D=Deleted
   Keys A: add partition, L: load backup, T: change type, P: list files,
        Enter: to continue
   FAT32, blocksize=4096, 448 MB / 428 MiB
   ```
   Now you need to change some of those `D` (Delete) in `P` (Primary) to avoid that during the conversion process your partition is not deleted. To do this, move to the **MS Data** partitions and set them to `P`. Some of them cannot be set as `P`, probably because they are corrupt or other issues but in your case you need only those ones containing your data or have important purposes. To understand this, you can read the information on the last column is present and the size between **Start** and **End** columns, just pick the largest one if the other partitions cannot be set to `P`:
   ```

   :::tip
   In case you delete a partition as mistake, don't write any data on your disk. Just use **testdisk** to retrieve your lost partition by selecting the disk containing the lost partition and select **Intel** option (unless you have a different kind of partition). Note that, when you restore lost partitions, testdisk could make your disk as **MBR**, so, in case you need to create in this disk an EFI partition, you must convert the disk as **GPT** as explained above.
   :::
12. run **format fs=fat32 quick** to format the EFI partition as fat32
13. run **assign letter=m**
14. exit
15. Supposing that your Windows installation is installed in **C:**, run **bcdboot c:\windows /s m: /f uefi**
16. If it does not produce error, type **exit** for exiting the Command Prompt and click on **Continue** button for entering to Windows
17. If it produces an error:
  * run **bootrec /fixmbr**
  * run **bootrec /fixboot**
  * run **bootrec /scanos**
  * run **bootrec /rebuildbcd**
  * run **bootsect.exe /nt60 all /force**
18. Exit from the Command Prompt and click on **Startup Repair** button. It should bring you to Windows.

:::note
In case you try to run **bcdedit** on Windows CMD to check the list of Windows Boot Manager entries, and you get an error like **Requested device cannot be found**, be sure your EFI partition is inside a **GPT** disk, otherwise you need to convert it as explained above.
:::
:::note
During the boot of the system, if your BIOS sees multiple **Windows Boot Manager** entries, where only one is working and the other ones are broken, on Windows CMD run `bcdedit /enum firmware`, detect the wrong entries (they should have description field as "Windows Boot Manager" and delete the one that has not **current** string in some fields. You can delete them by
```
bcdedit /delete \{THE_GUID\}
```
`\{THE_GUID\}` is the value in **identifier** field. You can do this also in Linux Live Environment by detecting the Windows Boot Manager entries to delete by `efibootmgr` command. Compare each entry's shown partition GUID and file path with the GUIDs in `partx /dev/nvme0n1` (replace `/dev/nvme0n1` by your disk), or use `efibootmgr -n XXXX` to temporarily select one specific entry for "next boot" (and reboot to test if it's the working one or not). Once you've determined which entry is bad, use `efibootmgr -b XXXX --delete-bootnum` to remove it.
:::

Finally, for fixing also the Linux access, burn Athena OS ISO on a USB and follow the steps explained at [Post-installation](/en/installation/install-persistent-usb/#post-installation) section.
