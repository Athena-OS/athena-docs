The following section will guide you through the steps to install Athena OS in a persistent USB by covering all the possible choices you could set.

Before starting, you need two USB drives:
* **USB-1**: for creating bootable media
* **USB-2**: on which persistent Athena OS will be installed

Burn Athena OS ISO on USB-1 as described in the [Baremetal installation prepare](/en/installation/prepare-baremetal/) guide.

After that, reboot the system while keeping USB-1 plugged in your USB port and, according to your boot mode (EFI or BIOS/Legacy), you will be shown:

![EFI Boot](@assets/images/efi-boot.png)

for **EFI boot**, select **Athena OS install medium** or:

![BIOS/Legacy Boot](@assets/images/bios-boot.png)

for **BIOS/Legacy boot**, select **Boot Athena OS (x86_64, BIOS, open source)**.

Once you land on the Live Environment, attach USB-2 to a different USB port and be sure it is working, and follow the [Calamares Installer](/en/configuration/calamares/) chapter until the **Partitions** section.

## Partitioning

On **Partitions** section, on **Select storage device** dropdown menu at top side, select the name of your USB-2 device and select **Manual Partitioning**.

You should:
* click on **New Partition Table** and select **GUID Partition Table**
* BIOS-GRUB. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 8 MB
  * File System: unformatted
  * Flags: bios-grub
  * Click OK
* Boot partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: 300 MB
  * File System: ext4 or fat32
  * Mount Point: /boot
  * Flags: boot (or boot-efi)
  * Click OK
* Data partition. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then:
  * Size: the remaining size
  * File System: btrfs (or any file system you wish)
  * Encrypt: select it if you want to encrypt your data partition
  * Mount Point: /
  * Click OK

You should have something like:
![USB Manual Partitioning](@assets/images/calamares-partition-usb.png)

or, for encrypted data partition, like

![USB Manual Partitioning Encryption](@assets/images/calamares-partition-usb-encrypted.png)

Then click **Next**. You will get some warning messages, just click **OK** and run the installation.

:::caution
Note that we don't create a SWAP space because Athena OS uses [ZRAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zram). In case you perform a custom configuration where you remove ZRAM and use ZSWAP, you can create the SWAP partition as above by setting:
* Swap Space if you wish to have it. Click on **Free Space** and click on **Create** then
  * Size: set a suitable size for Swap Space if you would like to set it (it should be a power of 2)
  * File System: linuxswap
  * Flags: swap
  * Click OK

:::danger
Note that by installing the system in a persistent USB, the GRUB installed on the hard disk will be deleted and you would need to reinstall it.
