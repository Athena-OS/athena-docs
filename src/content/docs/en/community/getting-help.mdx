## Documentation

Before opening a ticket, we suggest to consult the documentation in order to make **more efficient** our work.

Athena OS website provides a useful **online documentation** that explains how to use the environment and its resources in a very effective manner. For any issues consult the [documentation](/en/getting-started/athenaos/).

On the documentation website, you can use the **Search bar** for finding immediately the information you need.

For documentation related to tools installed in Athena, you can read the related documentation by accessing to **/usr/share/doc/\<toolname\>** directory.

Try also to give a look to the [Troubleshooting](/en/support/troubleshooting/) document or among the [opened](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) or [closed issue tickets](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to search for any solution in case it has been already reported by another user.

In case you are facing a persistent issue that could impact the most of the users, edit [Troubleshooting](/en/support/troubleshooting/) page in order to insert any workaround that could help other users to deal with the issue.
