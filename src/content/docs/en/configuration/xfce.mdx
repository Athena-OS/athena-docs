[XFCE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xfce) is a lightweight and modular desktop environment currently based on GTK 3.

In Athena OS, XFCE has been deployed in different environments.

## XFCE Picom

The environment is pretty simple and characterized by a lateral vertical bar that provides access to all applications and settings.

The XFCE lateral bar is composed of a menu on top of it that allows you to access to several applications.

Following the menu button, you can find circle icons that represent workspaces where to organize your work.

On the bottom side of the bar, several elements are shown as network connection, system metrics, audio settings, battery and power menu.

## XFCE Refined

Unlike the previous environment, it is composed of a top bar that provides access to all applications and settings, and a menu dock at bottom side.

Following the menu button, you can find some shortcuts and, on the right side, system metrics diagrams, emoji icons that represent workspaces where to organize your work and, finally, several elements as network connection, system metrics, audio settings, battery and power menu.

On the bottom side of the environment, a menu dock is implemented in order to access quickly to the cyber resources you need for your hacking activity.

## Desktop

The desktop in both of the XFCE environemnts is pretty simple in terms of elements. You have mainly a bar, a wallpaper and a sidebar on picom environment.

By right-click on the desktop, you can access to menu applications.
