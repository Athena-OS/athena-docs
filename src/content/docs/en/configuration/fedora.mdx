## Getting Started

Athena OS is migrating to Fedora-base in order to improve stability and security of the system.

A beta is available to be tested and published at https://hub.athenaos.org/athena-images/rolling/athenaos-live-x86_64.iso

## How To Use

User experience on Athena Fedora will be much similar to the Arch-based one with just one difference: the management of the packages.

Athena Fedora manages packages by using **dnf** instead than pacman. Here there are useful commands to start with:

### Package Installation

Install a package:
```shell
sudo dnf install <package-name>
```
Install a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf install -y <package-name>
```

Reinstall a package:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall <package-name>
```
Reinstall a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall -y <package-name>
```

### Package Removal

Remove a package:
```shell
sudo dnf remove <package-name>
```
Remove a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf remove -y <package-name>
```

### System Upgrade

Upgrade the system:
```shell
sudo dnf upgrade
```

### Package Version Downgrade

There are several methods to downgrade a package. By using:
```shell
sudo dnf downgrade <package-name>
```
the package will be downgrade on the early version, if it exists on the repository.

You can also downgrade a package to a specific version by getting the list of available versions:
```shell
dnf --showduplicates list <package-name>
```
and then installing your favourite version:
```shell
sudo dnf install <package-name>-<version>
```

After downgrading, you might want to hold the package:
```shell
sudo dnf versionlock add <package-name>
```
To unlock:
```shell
sudo dnf versionlock delete <package-name>
```

### Package Information

To check information about a remote package:
```shell
dnf info <package-name>
```

To check information about a local package:
```shell
dnf info --installed <package-name>
```
or
```shell
rpm -qi <package-name>
```

### Package Dependencies

To list all the dependencies required by a package:
```shell
dnf repoquery --requires <package-name>
```
or, for local packages only:
```shell
rpm -qR <package-name>
```

To list all the packages a specific package is a dependency:
```shell
dnf repoquery --whatrequires <package-name>
```
or, for installed packages only:
```shell
dnf repoquery --installed --whatrequires <package-name>
```

### Package File Details

To list all files installed by a package:
```shell
dnf repoquery --list <package-name>
```
or
```shell
rpm -ql <package-name>
```

To list a specific file to which package belongs:
```shell
rpm -qf /path/to/file
```

### Package Search

To check for all packages provided by your set repositories by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora 
dnf repoquery --repo=athenaos
dnf repoquery --repo=microsoft-fedora
```

To check for a specific package by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora libsecret
```
or you can use regex if you are not sure of the complete name:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora "libse*"
```
The value of `--repo=` parameter for each repository (official, third-party, COPR) set on your system can be found inside the first line of each file in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

Add RPM Fusion repository: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/

To check online if a package is provided by Official Fedora Repositories: https://packages.fedoraproject.org/
Or, to check  if a package exists in also Fedora Third-Party repositories (i.e., RPM Fusion): https://pkgs.org/
