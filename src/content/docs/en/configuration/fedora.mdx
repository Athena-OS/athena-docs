## Getting Started

Athena OS is migrating to Fedora-base in order to improve stability and security of the system.

A beta is available to be tested and published at https://hub.athenaos.org/athena-images/rolling/athenaos-live-x86_64.iso

## How To Use

User experience on Athena Fedora will be much similar to the Arch-based one with just one difference: the management of the packages.

Athena Fedora manages packages by using **dnf** instead than pacman. Here there are useful commands to start with:

Install a package:
```shell
sudo dnf install <package-name>
```
Install a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf install -y <package-name>
```

Reinstall a package:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall <package-name>
```
Reinstall a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall -y <package-name>
```

Remove a package:
```shell
sudo dnf remove <package-name>
```
Remove a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf remove -y <package-name>
```

Upgrade the system:
```shell
sudo dnf upgrade
```

To check for all packages provided by your set repositories by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora 
dnf repoquery --repo=athenaos
dnf repoquery --repo=microsoft-fedora
```

To check for a specific package by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora libsecret
```
or you can use regex if you are not sure of the complete name:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora "libse*"
```
The value of `--repo=` parameter for each repository set on your system can be found inside the first line of each file in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

Add RPM Fusion repository: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/

To check online if a package is provided by Official Fedora Repositories: https://packages.fedoraproject.org/
Or, to check  if a package exists in also Fedora Third-Party repositories (i.e., RPM Fusion): https://pkgs.org/
