## Introduction

During this period, and according to the preferences of the community, a **feasibility study** has been performed on using **Fedora** as base system for a **pentesting distribution**.

Our study identified very interesting advantages of designing a pentesting distro based on Fedora. For this reason, we decided to migrate Athena OS from Arch Linux to Fedora.

### Advantages of Athena Fedora over Arch

**Security-Enhanced Linux**

Athena Fedora will implement **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)** including security policies provided directly by Fedora and Red Hat Team, preinstalled and preconfigured for you. SELinux enforces a **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** through Linux Security Modules in the Linux kernel, in addition to the already provided **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**.  They are enforced in a separated manner providing a boost on the security of your system.

**Secure Boot Support**

**UEFI Secure Boot** is supported and ensures that only trusted software is allowed to start when your computer boots up. No malware or rootkits could try to take control before your OS even starts.

**Hardened Compiler Flags**

RPM packages that will be shipped in Athena are built with **hardened compiler flags** to mitigate memory corruption attacks.

**CI/CD Automation**

Athena OS infrastructure is integrated with Fedora infrastructure (COPR) in order to maintain, build and update packages with **no manual intervention**. It strongly reduces the effort of Athena maintainers that can focus on different aspects of the system.

**RPM packaging**

We are studying an efficient way to create and build packages for pentesting tools by RPM packages. It allows these pentesting tools to be used not only on Fedora-based systems but **on several different distros** (i.e., AlmaLinux, CentOS, RHEL, OpenSUSE).

**Stable vs Rolling releases**

On Arch-base the project suffered the weak point of a rolling release model, that could provide unstable packages that can brick the system.
The purpose of the project is to focus on **security and stability** over all. Stable releases could fit this target.


### Performance

The kernel includes a lot of important modules that in Arch must be manually included by adding a time delay during the installation.

During these last days, simple performance tests have been performed on QEMU/KVM and:
* The boot takes **4 seconds**
* The installation takes **6 minutes** by a standard Internet connection; in Athena Arch it needed 15 minutes


### Roadmap

A long-term target will be to make Athena OS the first **OSTree pentesting distribution**. It will boost much more security and stability of the system.

The purpose of this huge project is not only to set up a friendly environment for pentesters or red-teamers, but also to provide a **highly-secure system**, mostly for those users operating in **high-risky environments**.


## Getting Started

Athena OS is migrating to Fedora-base in order to improve stability and security of the system.

A beta is available to be tested and published at https://hub.athenaos.org/athena-images/rolling/athenaos-live-x86_64.iso

Currently, Athena Fedora does not ship pentesting tools but it just leverages on ones provided by Fedora repository itself.

A list of them can be found in the [Fedora Security Lab repository](https://pagure.io/security-lab/blob/master/f/security-menu).

In the future, we will submit much more pentesting tools in the repository.


## How To Use

User experience on Athena Fedora will be much similar to the Arch-based one with just one difference: the management of the packages.

Athena Fedora manages packages by using **dnf** instead than pacman. Here there are useful commands to start with:

### Package Installation

Install a package:
```shell
sudo dnf install <package-name>
```
Install a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf install -y <package-name>
```

Reinstall a package:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall <package-name>
```
Reinstall a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf reinstall -y <package-name>
```

### Package Removal

Remove a package:
```shell
sudo dnf remove <package-name>
```
Remove a package without providing confirmation:
```shell
sudo dnf remove -y <package-name>
```

### System Upgrade

Upgrade the system:
```shell
sudo dnf upgrade
```

### Package Version Downgrade

There are several methods to downgrade a package. By using:
```shell
sudo dnf downgrade <package-name>
```
the package will be downgrade on the early version, if it exists on the repository.

You can also downgrade a package to a specific version by getting the list of available versions:
```shell
dnf --showduplicates list <package-name>
```
and then installing your favourite version:
```shell
sudo dnf install <package-name>-<version>
```

After downgrading, you might want to hold the package:
```shell
sudo dnf versionlock add <package-name>
```
To unlock:
```shell
sudo dnf versionlock delete <package-name>
```

### Package Information

To check information about a remote package:
```shell
dnf info <package-name>
```

To check information about a local package:
```shell
dnf info --installed <package-name>
```
or
```shell
rpm -qi <package-name>
```

### Package Dependencies

To list all the dependencies required by a package:
```shell
dnf repoquery --requires <package-name>
```
or, for local packages only:
```shell
rpm -qR <package-name>
```

To list all the packages a specific package is a dependency:
```shell
dnf repoquery --whatrequires <package-name>
```
or, for installed packages only:
```shell
dnf repoquery --installed --whatrequires <package-name>
```

### Package File Details

To list all files installed by a package:
```shell
dnf repoquery --list <package-name>
```
or
```shell
rpm -ql <package-name>
```

To list a specific file to which package belongs:
```shell
rpm -qf /path/to/file
```

### Package Search

To check for all packages provided by your set repositories by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora 
dnf repoquery --repo=athenaos
dnf repoquery --repo=microsoft-fedora
```

To check for a specific package by command line:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora libsecret
```
or you can use regex if you are not sure of the complete name:
```shell
dnf repoquery --repo=fedora "libse*"
```
The value of `--repo=` parameter for each repository (official, third-party, COPR) set on your system can be found inside the first line of each file in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

Add RPM Fusion repository: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/rpmfusion-setup/

To check online if a package is provided by Official Fedora Repositories: https://packages.fedoraproject.org/
Or, to check  if a package exists in also Fedora Third-Party repositories (i.e., RPM Fusion): https://pkgs.org/
