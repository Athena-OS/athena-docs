Athena OS leverages on two repositories for accessing to security tools and learning resources in a comfortable manner. They are:
* [Athena Nix repository](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-nix) for all the modules designed specifically for Athena OS
* [Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) to retrieve all packages and security tools

Athena uses stable version of Nixpks repository and it is managed by Nix Channels. To keep the nix channel of the stable version updated, in order to retrieve always the most updated stable packages, run:
```shell
sudo nix-channel --update
```

Athena Nix repository can be used also by flakes. In this manner an host can retrieve a specific configuration set in Athena Nix remotely with minimum effort. The usage of flakes is specified in the main page of Athena Nix repository. To keep update flakes in order to retrieve always the latest updated packages, run:
```shell
sudo nix flake update
```

## Automation

Athena repository automates the update of its packages, indeed, mostly for git packages, when a developer updates its tool, the implemented automation is able to detect it, update the package and deploy it to the repository. This automated check runs periodically.

It has been implemented by a GitHub Actions workflow that contains a bash script for checking all directories containing a PKGBUILD file and running the build script inside each package source.
