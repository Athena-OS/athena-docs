Athena OS leverages on several repositories for accessing to security tools and learning resources in a comfortable manner. They are:
* [Athena repository](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena) for new tools or packages not stored in other existing repositories
* [BlackArch repository](https://blackarch.org/) for retrieving all the security tools
* [Chaotic repository](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) for accessing to the AUR packages directly by pacman
* [Arch Linux repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/) for system and utility packages
  * core
  * extra
  * community
  * multilib

These repositories are set in `/etc/pacman.conf`. Here you can choose to add more repositories or remove the existing ones. Each time you edit this file by adding or removing repositories, run `sudo pacman -Syy` to synchronize the database.

The structure of the Athena OS [repository package source](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena/tree/main/packages) is public and available for any contribution.

The source files of each single package is inside the `packages` directory. Each package has `PKGBUILD` file for defining the `.pkg.tar.zst` package rules and `build.sh` is used for automating this process by generating the new `.pkg.tar.zst`, signing it, moving it and its signature to `x86_64` folder and delete all the temporary files.
When all packages are built, they are moved to the actual [Athena Repository](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-repository) and `update-database.sh` must be run for calling `update_repo.sh` script in order to update the `athena.db*` files with the new built packages with `.pkg.tar.zst` extension stored in `x86_64` folder.

The declaration of Athena repository is defined inside `/etc/pacman.conf` as:
```
[athena]
SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly
Include = /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist
```
In Athena, the repository keys and related files, `athena.gpg`, `athena-trusted`, `athena-revoked`, `blackarch.gpg`, `blackarch-trusted`, `blackarch-revoked`, `chaotic.gpg`, `chaotic-trusted` and `chaotic-revoked` files are stored in `/usr/share/pacman/keyrings/` folder. `athena.gpg` file is the public key needed to be imported in order to access to Athena repository, `athena-trusted` contains the keys to trust, and `athena-revoked` contains the list of revoked keys in long format.
This operation is managed by Calamares installer that will initialize all the keys stored in `/usr/share/pacman/keyrings/` folder.

## Automation

Athena repository automates the update of its packages, indeed, mostly for git packages, when a developer updates its tool, the implemented automation is able to detect it, update the package and deploy it to the repository. This automated check runs periodically.

It has been implemented by a GitHub Actions workflow that contains a bash script for checking all directories containing a PKGBUILD file and running the build script inside each package source.

## Installation

If you wish to use Athena repository in a different operating system, you can do this by adding the following to your **/etc/pacman.conf**:
```
[athena]
SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly
Include = /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist
```
Get the mirrorlist file by running:
```shell
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athena-OS/athena/main/packages/os-specific/athena-mirrorlist/athena-mirrorlist -o /etc/pacman.d/athena-mirrorlist
```
On the terminal, execute:
```shell
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys A3F78B994C2171D5 --keyserver keys.openpgp.org
```
:::tip
If it is not working, try:
```shell
sudo pacman-key --recv-keys A3F78B994C2171D5 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
```
:::
Finally, trust the imported key by:
```shell
sudo pacman-key --lsign A3F78B994C2171D5
```
