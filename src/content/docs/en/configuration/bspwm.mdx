[Bspwm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bspwm) is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree.

In Athena OS, Bspwm shows different rices to fit the best workspace environment the user would like to work on.

The environment consists of several elements that will shown in this chapter.

Each Bspwm rice has its own bar but they provides common features:

#### Application Menu
By clicking on Athena or Arch logo icon, or by pressing **SUPER + SPACE** on your keyboard, the Application Menu will spawn. Here, you can find and open any installed application you wish to run.

#### Window Switcher
Some rices have an icon showing overlapping windows that help you to switch among opened windows. In the image below, the window switcher is opened on the workspace 3 and shows windows opened in workspace 1 and 2.

You can also spawn it by pressing **CTRL + ALT + W**.

#### Workspaces
All the rices allow you to switch among workspaces. The difference of workspace menu inside each rice consists only of icons: glyphs or numbers.

#### Hack The Box Toolkit
Bspwm environment integrates with Hack The Box platform. **TODO**

#### System Metrics

On the bar, you can find some metrics about the system resource consumption like brightness percentage, disk space, CPU and RAM usage.

By clicking on the disk space icon, you can mount any existing drives (i.e., disk, partition or USB drives) to your system.

![Bspwm Mount](@assets/images/bspwm-mount.png)

As example, if you would like to use your USB drive, plug it in your computer, click on disk space icon, and on the popup window move to **Mount** and press **Enter**. You will get a list of drives, and among them, you will get the disk and the partition of your USB drive, for example in my case:
```
/dev/sdb (14.6 G) disk
/dev/sdb1 (14.6 G) part
```
You must select the **part** element in order to see the files inside your USB drive. Then, a name of folder where the USB drive should be mounted will be asked to you, and, finally, you can access to it by `ls /mnt/d_mount/<folder-name>`.

Once you finished your activity by USB drive, you can unmount it by clicking on disk space icon, move to **Umount** and press **Enter**.

#### Network, Audio and Power

WiFi icon allows you to connect to a network while Bluetooth one to a Bluetooth device. In this part of the bar, you can also tune your volume and update your packages.

Finally, a power icon button allows you to logout, lock, restart or shutdown your system.

## Desktop

The desktop is pretty simple in terms of elements. You have mainly a bar and a wallpaper.

If you wish to change your rice, press **ALT + SPACE** on your keyboard. A popup window containing the list of the rices appears:
