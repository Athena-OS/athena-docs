[KDE Plasma](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE) is a collection of libraries and frameworks (KDE Frameworks) and several applications (KDE Applications) as well.

In Athena OS, KDE Plasma provides the essential elements to perform your activities.

## Desktop

The environment is pretty characterized by a bottom bar that provides access to all applications and settings.

It allows you to access to several applications as well as cyber resources and tools.

On the right side of the bar, several elements are shown as network connection, audio settings, battery, calendar and other useful stuff.

In KDE Plasma you can quickly access to applications and browser bookmarks by KRunner invoked by **ALT + Space**.
