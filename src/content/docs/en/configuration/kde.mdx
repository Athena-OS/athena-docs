[KDE Plasma](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE) is a collection of libraries and frameworks (KDE Frameworks) and several applications (KDE Applications) as well.

In Athena OS, KDE Plasma provides the essential elements to perform your activities. 

The environment is pretty characterized by a bottom bar that provides access to all applications and settings.
