[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks. Note: it's in beta.

In Athena OS, Hyprland has been been set up to make the user experience smoother in a window manager environment.

It doesn't work [in virtual machines](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/#vm) out of the box, so it is suggested to use it on bare metal.

Athena's Hyprland config is based on the wonderful [dotfiles from @end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

The environment consists of several applications distributed between the top bar and the desktop environment.

:::note
If you have problems with shell elements, press **Ctrl+Super+R** to reload them

## Top Bar

![Hyprland Top Bar](@assets/images/hyprland-topbar.png)
From left to right, we have
- **Focused window title**
- **RAM usage** (Swap and CPU will be shown when there's no playing media)
- **Media title**
- **Workspace indicator**: Displays focused and occupied workspaces. Scroll to switch between them.
- **Time & date**
- **Utility buttons + battery indicator** (on a desktop with no battery, these two widgets are replaced with a weather widget)
- **Other status indicators**: System tray, Network, Bluetooth (and connected Bluetooth devices)

The media controls in the middle can be opened by clicking the media title on the bar or hitting **Super+M**

## Sidebars

![Sidebars](@assets/images/hyprland-sidebars.png)

While they're pretty self-explanatory, we have:
- Left sidebar: AI assistants: Gemini and ChatGPT (and other bots with compatible API) (API key required, but it'll guide you)
- Right sidebar:
  - Quick settings, like wifi/bluetooth toggles
  - Notifications
  - Calendar and To-Do list

## Desktop

A clean desktop view looks like this:

Typically, you launch apps either using the terminal or the launcher. With default keybindings:
- Hit **Super+Enter** to spawn a terminal
- Hit **Super** for the overview/launcher
  - This shows you open apps across workspaces
  - To search for apps, simply start typing. Use arrow keys to pick your desired app and hit **Enter**

## Settings

### Power Settings

You can change the inactivity duration after which the system will be locked by editing `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf`
Edit the lines that say timeout=NUMBER. The number is in seconds. 

For example, if you want your device to sleep after 15 minutes, the `listener` entry for it should look like this:
```ini
listener {
    timeout = 900  # = 15 Ã— 60 seconds
    on-timeout = $suspend_cmd
}
```

## Customization

### Changing wallpaper

- Hit **Super** to open the launcher and type in `>img`. A popup will show up, allowing you to select an image.
  - The color of shell elements will change according to the chosen wallpaper

### Environment

To configure your environment, take a look at these directories:
* **~/.config/hypr**: Config files for Hyprland and its utilities
    * **hyprland**
        * **env.conf**: Environment variables
        * **execs.conf**: Programs to run at startup
        * **keybinds.conf**: Keybinds
        * **general.conf**: General behavior
    * **hypridle.conf**: Power settings, as mentioned above
    * **hyprlock.conf**: Lock screen
* **~/.config/ags**: AGS stands for "Aylur's Gtk Shell". This folder contains the config of shell elements like bars and sidebars. Normal users would want to edit `user_options.js`, while advanced users might want to edit the code in there.
* **~/.local/bin**: Contains scripts and possibly binaries
