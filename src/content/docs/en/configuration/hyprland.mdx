[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks. Note: it's in beta.

Being very customizable, in Athena OS, Hyprland has been been set up with its minimum configuration. Each user can find and setup its favourite dotfiles.

It doesn't work [in virtual machines](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/#vm) out of the box, so it is suggested to use it on bare metal.

To start its configuration, first open the terminal by pressing **SUPER+Q**. If the terminal does not fit your screen, press **SUPER** and left mouse button to move the window over the screen, or **SUPER** and the right mouse button to resize each side of the window itself.

Once you get the shell, type **firefox** to open the browser and find your preferred Hyprland configuration to apply. GitHub has a lot of repositories related to it.
