[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

In Athena OS, Hyprland has been configured in order to **facilitate** the **user experience** in a window manager environment.

Currently, since Hyprland project is in beta, it could not work on virtual machines that don't allow **GPU passthrough**, so it is strongly suggested to use it in a baremetal configuration.

Hyprland used in Athena OS is inspired on the wonderful work of [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

The environment consists of several applications distributed between the top bar and the desktop environment.

:::caution
Hyprland is still in beta. If you get some issues, just press **Super + CTRL + R** to restore Hyprland environment.

## Top Bar

The top bar offers several interesting items useful to manage your environment.

![Hyprland Top Bar](@assets/images/hyprland-topbar.png)

On the top-left side of top bar, a label with the current active window name is shown.

The environment has a **media player** integrated with YouTube and Spotify in order to show the playing music.

Music popup window can be hidden or invoked by **Super+M**.

At the center of the top bar, the **workspace list** is placed. It shows active and used workspaces by using circles.

The right side of the top bar starts with a **calendar** and battery level bar.

Along these elements, it is possible to access to the keyboard and system settings where you can select your network connections, access to Bluetooth functionalities, access to power menu, read notifications and manage To-Do task notes.

## Desktop

A clean desktop view appears like the following:

This environment hides several useful resouces that can be invoked by keybindings. By considering you are using the default keybindings, you can invoke the **terminal** by **Super+Enter**.

On Desktop, the application search can be called. It shows the overview of the current workspaces showing the active applications inside them and provides a search bar to find local applications or remote resources. Furthermore, it provides built-in functionalities as math operations or running commands.

![Hyprland Activity Overview](@assets/images/hyprland-activity-overview.png)

By typing on the search bar, you can find all the resources you need or running commands. You can move by arrow keyboard for selecting the item and Enter key for running it.

## Settings

### Power Settings

The timeout before locking or suspending the system is specified in `$HOME/.config/hypr/execs.conf` in the following lines:
```
exec-once = swayidle -w timeout 300 '$HOME/.local/bin/lock.sh' before-sleep '$HOME/.local/bin/lock.sh' &
exec-once = swayidle -w timeout 450 'systemctl suspend'
```
Edit the timeout value to change the trigger of lock screen and system suspend. You can also edit the behavior of these two commands by changing the last parameters or creating a new command in a new line.

At the end, reboot.

## Customization

At any time you can choose to customize the current environment or to use a different theme.

### Environment

Hyprland leverages on several files for applying its current theme. These files are distributed mainly between:
* **~/.config/hypr**: containing all Hyprland configuration files (as keybindings, startup applications, background)
* **~/.config/ags**: containing all AGS configuration files
* **~/.local/bin**: containing binaries used for this theme

Files in **~/.config/hypr** that you can customize are:
* **env.conf**: define environment variables to be used in Hyprland
* **execs.conf**: define the processes to start at Hyprland startup
* **keybindings.conf**: define the keybindings for launching applications and actions
* **hyprland.conf**: define several settings for Hyprland environment and invoke the previous configuration files above

Customize them according to your needs.

If you wish to change the Desktop background, rename your image as **wallpaper** and just replace **~/.config/hypr/wallpaper** by your image file and reboot. To change it in runtime, run also:
```
swww img $HOME/.config/hypr/wallpaper
```

### Theme

If you would like to change the entire theme of Hyprland and applying a different one, you need to search for different. Usually, Hyprland themes are distributed as **dotfiles**. Dotfiles are named in this manner because they are the usual folder in your home directory that start with **.** in their name. So, a Hyprland theme typically consists of a **.config** and **.local** folders, but they could have also more of them.

For applying an Hyprland theme, you must copy the content of these folders in the related **dot folders** inside your home directory. If there is no error in Hyprland configuration, the theme should be applied automatically.
