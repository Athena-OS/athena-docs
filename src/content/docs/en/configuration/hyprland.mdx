[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

In Athena OS, Hyprland has been configured in order to **facilitate** the **user experience** in a window manager environment. In general, Hyprland does not support NVIDIA GPU but on Athena OS, a special **NVIDIA dedicated package** has been used in order to make Hyprland working also on their endpoints using NVIDIA GPUs.

Currently, since Hyprland project is in beta, it does not work on virtual machines that don't allow **GPU passthrough**, so it is strongly suggested to use it in a baremetal configuration.

Hyprland used in Athena OS is inspired on the wonderful work of [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

The environment consists of several applications distributed between the top bar and the desktop environment.

:::caution
Hyprland is still in beta, and it could happen that some buttons or windows become unclickable due to an invisible frame. For solving this situation, just press **Super+SHIFT+R** to restore Hyprland environment.

## Top Bar

The top bar offers several interesting items useful to manage your environment. On the left side there is a gear icon allowing you to access to the so called **OSettings**.

OSettings keeps also buttons for power manager (lock, suspend, logout, shutdown) and for Hyprland itself.

The environment has a **media player** integrated with YouTube and Spotify in order to show the playing music.

At the center of the top bar, there are two useful elements: the **application search** and the **workspace list**.

The application search opens the overview of the current workspaces showing the active applications inside them. The workspace list allows you to switch quickly to the different workspaces.

Furthermore, by typing on the search bar, you can find all the installed applications you need to use. You can move by arrow keyboard for selecting the application and Enter key for running it.

The right side of the top bar starts with the **Color Profiles** button. It can be used for setting new colors on your environment according to the one specified in the configuration files.

Finally, the last set of buttons allows you to access to **ONotify** that is the place where the notifications are kept, the Network connection, Bluetooth, Airplane mode and Power can be managed, and the calendar is shown.

A clean desktop view appears like the following:

This environment hides several useful resouces that can be invoked by keybindings. By considering you are using the default keybindings, you can invoke the **terminal** by **Super+Enter**.
