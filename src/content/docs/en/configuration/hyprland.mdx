[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks. Note: it's in beta.

In Athena OS, Hyprland has been been set up to make the user experience smoother in a window manager environment.

It doesn't work [in virtual machines](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Master-Tutorial/#vm) out of the box, so it is suggested to use it on bare metal.

Athena's Hyprland config is based on the wonderful [dotfiles from @mylinuxforwork](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles).

To install it, you must select Hyprland during Athena installation. At reboot, you will land on default Hyprland environment. Open the terminal by `SUPER + Q` and run:
```shell
ml4w-hyprland-setup
```
select `arch` and follow the interactive instructions according to your preferences.

Finally, reboot your system.
