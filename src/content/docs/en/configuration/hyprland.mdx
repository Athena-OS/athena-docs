[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

In Athena OS, Hyprland has been configured in order to **facilitate** the **user experience** in a window manager environment. In general, Hyprland does not support NVIDIA GPU but on Athena OS, a special **NVIDIA dedicated package** has been used in order to make Hyprland working also on their endpoints using NVIDIA GPUs.

Currently, since Hyprland project is in beta, it does not work on virtual machines that don't allow **GPU passthrough**, so it is strongly suggested to use it in a baremetal configuration.

Hyprland used in Athena OS is inspired on the wonderful work of [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

The environment consists of several applications distributed between the top bar and the desktop environment.

:::caution
Hyprland is still in beta, and it could happen that some buttons or windows become unclickable due to an invisible frame. For solving this issue, just press **Super+SHIFT+R** to restore Hyprland environment.

## Top Bar

The top bar offers several interesting items useful to manage your environment. On the left side there is a gear icon allowing you to access to the so called **OSettings**.

OSettings keeps also buttons for power manager (lock, suspend, logout, shutdown) and for Hyprland itself.

The environment has a **media player** integrated with YouTube and Spotify in order to show the playing music.

At the center of the top bar, there are two useful elements: the **application search** and the **workspace list**.

The application search opens the overview of the current workspaces showing the active applications inside them. The workspace list allows you to switch quickly to the different workspaces.

Furthermore, by typing on the search bar, you can find all the installed applications you need to use. You can move by arrow keyboard for selecting the application and Enter key for running it.

The right side of the top bar starts with the **Color Profiles** button. It can be used for setting new colors on your environment according to the one specified in the configuration files.

Finally, the last set of buttons allows you to access to **ONotify** that is the place where the notifications are kept, the Network connection, Bluetooth, Airplane mode and Power can be managed, and the calendar is shown.

## Desktop

A clean desktop view appears like the following:

This environment hides several useful resouces that can be invoked by keybindings. By considering you are using the default keybindings, you can invoke the **terminal** by **Super+Enter**.

![Hyprland Terminal](@assets/images/hyprland-terminal.png)

By pressing **Super+G** will popup the **perfomance monitoring** window.

You can also pull up the **music bar view** by **Super+M** button.

If you would like to have a **summary dashboard** about the main information and buttons to interact with the environment, press **Super+D**.

![Hyprland Dashboard Overview](@assets/images/hyprland-widget.png)

A more **complete dashboard** with more information can be reached by **Super+CTRL+D**.

## Settings

### Power Settings

The timeout before locking or suspending the system is specified in `$HOME/.config/hypr/execs.conf` in the following lines:
```
exec-once = swayidle -w timeout 300 '$HOME/.local/bin/lock.sh' before-sleep '$HOME/.local/bin/lock.sh' &
exec-once = swayidle -w timeout 450 'systemctl suspend'
```
Edit the timeout value to change the trigger of lock screen and system suspend. You can also edit the behavior of these two commands by changing the last parameters or creating a new command in a new line.

At the end, reboot.

## Customization

At any time you can choose to customize the current environment or to use a different theme.

### Customize Environment

Hyprland leverages on several files for applying its current theme. These files are distributed mainly between:
* **~/.config/hypr**: containing all Hyprland configuration files (as keybindings, startup applications, background)
* **~/.config/eww**: containing all eww configuration files (as top bar, OSettings, ONotify)
* **~/.local/bin**: containing binaries used for this theme
* **~/.local/share**: containing icon theme and font

Files in **~/.config/hypr** that you can customize are:
* **env.conf**: define environment variables to be used in Hyprland
* **execs.conf**: define the processes to start at Hyprland startup
* **keybindings.conf**: define the keybindings for launching applications and actions
* **hyprland.conf**: define several settings for Hyprland environment and invoke the previous configuration files above

Customize them according to your needs.

If you wish to change the Desktop background, rename your image as **wallpaper** and just replace **~/.config/eww/images/wallpaper/wallpaper** by your image file.

### Customize Theme

If you would like to change the entire theme of Hyprland and applying a different one, you need to search for different. Usually, Hyprland themes are distributed as **dotfiles**. Dotfiles are named in this manner because they are the usual folder in your home directory that start with **.** in their name. So, a Hyprland theme typically consists of a **.config** and **.local** folders, but they could have also more of them.

For applying an Hyprland theme, you must copy the content of these folders in the related **dot folders** inside your home directory. If there is no error in Hyprland configuration, the theme should be applied automatically.
