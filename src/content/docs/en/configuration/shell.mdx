In Athena OS, four shells are mainly used: **Bash**, **Fish**, **Zsh** and **PowerShell**. For Bash, Fish, Zsh the same prompt pattern has been used.

At installation time, the user can choose between Bash, Fish and Zsh. However, Bash and PowerShell are installed by default.

## Bash

[Bash](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bash) (Bourne-again Shell) is a command-line shell/programming language by the GNU Project. Bash is the default command-line shell on Athena OS. Here, Bash implements **autosuggestion** and **autocompletion** features in order to increase the user experience.

Generally, Bash is not able to retrieve the new configuration on `.bashrc` automatically. For example, if the shell prompt changes due to a command, this change is not applied on the current shell session. Athena solved this, by adding the following line on `.bashrc`:
```
export PROMPT_COMMAND='source ~/.bashrc no-repeat-flag'
```

## Fish

[Fish](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fish) (Friendly interactive shell), is a command-line shell intended to be interactive and user-friendly. Fish is intentionally not fully POSIX compliant, it aims at addressing POSIX inconsistencies with a simplified or a different syntax.

The implementation of Fish shell has been decided according to some characteristics as:
* Extensive UI: syntax highlighting, autosuggestion, tab completion and selection lists that can be navigated and filtered.
* No configuration needed: Fish is designed to be ready to use immediately, without requiring extensive configuration.
* Easy scripting: new functions can be added on the fly. The syntax is easy to learn and use.

Since Fish and Bash use different statements, at the beginning of the session, the user is associated with Bash because several bash scripts must be sourced at the login (i.e., `/etc/profile.d/` scripts). When the user opens a terminal, `.bashrc` is sourced for setting configuration and variables and at the end it executes FISH.

Finally, for [keeping FISH as shell](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fish#Modify_.bashrc_to_drop_into_fish) even if in the terminal we open new tabs and preventing that it switches to BASH, the following code has been added at the end of `.bashrc` and delete each `alias ps` in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases` file for avoding conflicting errors:
```
[[ $(ps --no-header --pid=$PPID --format=comm) != "${SHELL#/usr/bin/}" && -z ${BASH_EXECUTION_STRING} && ${SHELL} != "/usr/bin/bash" ]] && exec $SHELL
```

## Zsh

[Zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/zsh) is a powerful shell that operates as both an interactive shell and as a scripting language interpreter. While being compatible with the POSIX sh (not by default, only if issuing emulate sh), it offers advantages such as improved tab completion and globbing.

In general, Zsh is not able to retrieve the new configuration on `.zshrc` automatically. For example, if the shell prompt changes due to a command, this change is not applied on the current shell session. For solving this, on `.zshrc` the following lines have been added:
```
precmd() { eval "$PROMPT_COMMAND" }
export PROMPT_COMMAND='source ~/.zshrc no-repeat-flag'
```

In Athena OS, Zsh implements **autosuggestion**, **globbing** and **autocompletion** features in order to increase the user experience.

## PowerShell
[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview) is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework.

In Athena OS, PowerShell has been implemented by adding a lot of useful modules that can improve the efficiency of the user activity.

## Aliases

On Bash, Fish and Zsh are set several shells defined in `~/.bash_aliases`. They can vary between Athena Arch and Athena Nix. The most useful aliases are:
