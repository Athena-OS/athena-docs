[Aegis TUI](https://github.com/Athena-OS/aegis-tui) is a terminal user interface frontend of **Aegis**, a tailored installer developed and optimized specifically for Athena OS.

To provide more accessible resources to the users, Aegis TUI provides a terminal interface to configure and install your systems according to your preferences.

Aegis will improve over time in order to detect automatically your hardware. It means that the installer is able to detect your environment (baremetal or virtualized), your CPU and your GPU. According to this information, all the needed drivers are automatically installed with no any actions by your side.

Aegis TUI can be run by running `aegis-tui` command and requires a working Internet connection.

Its purpose is to create a JSON configuration file containing all the user choices that is used to feed the Aegis backend, the real brain of the installer. The JSON configuration file will be saved as `/tmp/config.json`.

The installation logs will be saved to `/tmp/aegis.log` and copied to the installed system to `/var/log/aegis.log`.
