[Aegis TUI](https://github.com/Athena-OS/aegis-tui) is a terminal user interface frontend of **Aegis**, a tailored installer developed and optimized specifically for Athena OS.

To provide more accessible resources to the users, Aegis TUI provides a terminal interface to configure and install your systems according to your preferences.

Aegis will improve over time in order to detect automatically your hardware. It means that the installer is able to detect your environment (baremetal or virtualized), your CPU and your GPU. According to this information, all the needed drivers are automatically installed with no any actions by your side.

Aegis TUI can be run by running `aegis-tui` command and requires a working Internet connection.

Its purpose is to create a JSON configuration file containing all the user choices that is used to feed the Aegis backend, the real brain of the installer. The JSON configuration file will be saved as `/tmp/config.json`.

The installation logs will be saved to `/tmp/aegis.log` and copied to the installed system to `/var/log/aegis.log`.

    ![Installation Finished](@assets/images/aegis-tui-finish.png)

    :::note
    At the end of a successful installation in an EFI system, you could get a message like:
    ```
    ⚠ Mount point '/boot' which backs the random seed file is world accessible, which is a security hole! ⚠
    ⚠ Random seed file '/boot/loader/.#bootctlrandom-seedc5706ea22f8895b0' is world accessible, which is a security hole! ⚠
    Random seed file /boot/loader/random-seed successfully written (32 bytes).
    ```
    It is related to all Linux systems, but it should be mitigated by using encrypted partitions. To get more details about this warning, refer to [this resource](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/security-warning-when-installing-nixos-23-11/37636).
