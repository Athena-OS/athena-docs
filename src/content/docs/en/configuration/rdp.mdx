Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.

## Setting RDP

Install Xrdp and the Xorg backend:
```shell
sudo pacman -Syyu xrdp xorgxrdp
```
Then, enable the xrdp service:
```shell
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
```
Create the `~/.xinitrc` file with the following content:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# ~/.xinitrc
#
# Executed by startx (run your window manager from here)

userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
usermodmap=$HOME/.Xmodmap
sysresources=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xresources
sysmodmap=/etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap

# merge in defaults and keymaps

if [ -f $sysresources ]; then
	xrdb -merge $sysresources
fi

if [ -f $sysmodmap ]; then
	xmodmap $sysmodmap
fi

if [ -f "$userresources" ]; then
	xrdb -merge "$userresources"
fi

if [ -f "$usermodmap" ]; then
	xmodmap "$usermodmap"
fi

# start some nice programs

if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
	for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/?*.sh; do
		[ -x "$f" ] && . "$f"
	done
	unset f
fi

# Workaround for GNOME apps starting slowly
# See: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=224787
dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DISPLAY XAUTHORITY

# Start the GNOME session
exec gnome-session
```
:::tip
Replace `gnome-session` by the related session executable of your desktop environment.
:::

Finally, reboot the system and don't login inside the system otherwise you cannot login by RDP. Only one user session is allowed at time.

Open your RDP client, retrieve the IP address of your system and login by your user account credentials.
