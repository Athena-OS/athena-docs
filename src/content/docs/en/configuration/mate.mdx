[MATE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MATE) provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

In Athena OS, MATE provides quick access to cyber resources.

The environment consists of several applications that will shown in this chapter.

## Desktop

The desktop consists of a top bar and bottom bar as long as desktop icons.

MATE top bar is composed of several elements that provide access to several resources as settings, directories and application list.
