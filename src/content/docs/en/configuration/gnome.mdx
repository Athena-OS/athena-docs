[GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME) is a desktop environment that aims to be simple and easy to use.

In Athena OS, GNOME has been configured in order to decrease the usage complexity and to improve the user desktop experience.

The environment consists of several applications that will shown in this chapter.

## Top Bar

The GNOME top bar is composed of **Logo Menu** extension that provides a menu to access to several resources as settings, software center and application list.

As example, by clicking on **Software Center...** you can access to its application for getting the applications you need. Note that the shown applications are managed by **flatpak** and they are retrieved from **Flathub**, not from Arch repositories. By default, no apps are shown because you need to install flatpak by `sudo pacman -S flatpak packagekit`.

One of main menus in GNOME is **Arc Menu** that allows you to quickly access to **Blue** and **Red Team** tools, as well as usual application and system instruments

Next to Arc Menu, a **calendar** is placed along with an incoming notifications view

On the right side of the top bar, you can find some metrics about the system resource consumption.

It gives you also information about physical metrics as Temperature, Voltage and Fan. Furthermore, by the buttons on the bottom side, you can access to other resources as **GNOME Monitor**.

Going forward, the **Pop Shell** extension allows you to change some settings and mainly to switch between stacked windows and tiling windows.

At the end there is the power and settings menu that could be used for using power options (shutdown, reboot, logout), accessing system settings or taking screenshots.

## Desktop

The desktop is pretty simple in terms of elements. Default GNOME usually does not show desktop icons. Here, you can have them.

At the bottom side, a **Menu Dock** has been implemented showing the pinned applications of the system and the active ones.

By pressing `Super` key (i.e., `Windows` key), or by the Menu Dock on **Show Apps** or Logo Menu on **App Grid** button, you can access to the installed applications.
