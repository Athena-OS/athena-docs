[GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME) is a desktop environment that aims to be simple and easy to use.

In Athena OS, GNOME has been configured in order to decrease the usage complexity and to improve the user desktop experience.

![GNOME Environment](@assets/images/gnome-sweetdark.png)

The environment consists of several applications that will shown in this chapter.

## Desktop

The desktop is pretty simple in terms of elements.

GNOME top bar is composed of **Logo Menu** extension that provides a menu to access to several resources as settings, software center and application list.

![GNOME Logo Menu](@assets/images/gnome-logomenu.png)

As example, by clicking on **Software Center...** you can access to its application for getting the applications you need. Note that the shown applications are managed by **flatpak** and they are retrieved from **Flathub**, not from Arch repository or Nix repository. By default, no apps are shown because you need to install `flatpak` and `packagekit` packages.

![GNOME Software Center](@assets/images/gnome-softwarecenter.png)

One of main menus in GNOME is **Arc Menu** that allows you to quickly access to **Blue** and **Red Team** tools, as well as usual application and system instruments

![GNOME Arc Menu](@assets/images/gnome-arcmenu.png)

Next to Arc Menu, a **calendar** is placed along with an incoming notifications view

![GNOME Calendar](@assets/images/gnome-calendar.png)

{/*
At the center of the top bar, several **workspaces** have been set. They have been conceived to be used for different activities, for example:
* üïµÔ∏è Cyber Security
* üìñ Coding
* üçí Note Taking
* üé∏ Music
* üéÆ Recreation
* üêù Misc

![GNOME Workspaces](@assets/images/gnome-workspaces.png)

By clicking on one of them, you will be switched to the related workspace.

On the right side of the top bar, by clicking on the statement **Athena is Great!**, a set of widgets appears.

![GNOME Widget](@assets/images/gnome-widget.png)
![GNOME Dashboard](@assets/images/gnome-dashboard.png)

Here, you can access to several resources.
*/} 

On the right side of the top bar, you can find some metrics about the system resource consumption.

![GNOME Vitals](@assets/images/gnome-vitals.png)

It gives you also information about physical metrics as Temperature, Voltage and Fan. Furthermore, by the buttons on the bottom side, you can access to other resources as **GNOME Monitor**.

![GNOME Monitor](@assets/images/gnome-monitor.png)

Going forward, the **Pop Shell** extension allows you to change some settings and mainly to switch between stacked windows and tiling windows.

![GNOME Pop Shell](@assets/images/gnome-pop.png)

At the end there is the power and settings menu that could be used for using power options (shutdown, reboot, logout), accessing system settings or taking screenshots.

![GNOME Power Menu](@assets/images/gnome-power.png)

At the bottom side of the desktop, a **Menu Dock** has been implemented showing the pinned applications of the system and the active ones.

![GNOME Menu Dock](@assets/images/gnome-dock.png)

{/*
GNOME in Athena offers also the **Gestures Improvement** extension that allow you to improve touchpad gestures. It can be managed by accessing to the Extensions, finding this extension and clicking on **Settings**.

![GNOME Gestures](@assets/images/gnome-gestures.png)
*/} 

By pressing `Super` key (i.e., `Windows` key), or by the Menu Dock on **Show Apps** or Logo Menu on **App Grid** button, you can access to the installed applications.

![GNOME Application Grid](@assets/images/gnome-applications.png)

Default GNOME usually does not show desktop icons. Here, you can have them.

## Customization

I you wish to change some GNOME elements in Athena OS, you can follow this guide to get the right steps and transform Athena according to your taste.

GNOME is composed of several resources and we will discuss each one of them in order to tweak it as possible.

### Background

Backgrounds are stored in:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Athena Arch">
`/usr/share/backgrounds/default/` folder.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Athena Nix">
`/run/current-system/sw/share/backgrounds/athena/` folder.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you wish to change only the background, you can do it by different ways.

The first one is to go to the top-right **power button** -> **gear icon** -> the Settings window appears -> **Appearance** -> click on **Add Picture...** and select your favourite background.

![GNOME Settings Background](@assets/images/gnome-custom-background.png)

Here you can change also if applying a light or dark theme.

Another method is to use **GNOME Tweaks**. Go to the **App Grid** or press **Super** key two times, and search for **GNOME Tweaks** or **Tweaks**, usually it is inside the **Utilities** group and launch it.

When the GNOME Tweaks is opened, move to **Appearance** tab and tweak your image and its adjustment under the **Background** section.

![GNOME Tweaks Background](@assets/images/gnome-custom-tweaks-background.png)

An additional method is by terminal. Run:
```shell
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri-dark background.png
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options stretched
```
**stretched** is used to adjust the image in order to fill the entire screen.

:::tip
If you are using a dark theme, use **picture-uri-dark**. If you are using a light theme, replace **picture-uri-dark** by **picture-uri** parameter.
