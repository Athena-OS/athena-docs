[GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME) is a desktop environment that aims to be simple and easy to use.

In Athena OS, GNOME has been configured in order to decrease the usage complexity and to improve the user desktop experience.

## Desktop

The desktop is pretty simple in terms of elements. Default GNOME usually does not show desktop icons. Here, you can have them.

At the bottom side, a **Menu Dock** has been implemented showing the pinned applications of the system and the active ones.
