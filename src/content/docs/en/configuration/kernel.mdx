Athena OS offers several kernels that could be set after the installation.

By default, Athena OS adopts the **LTS Kernel** because it is one of the officially supported kernels and it is characterized to be stable and to have low-latency computing.

The list of available kernels the user can be installed is the following:
- **Linux Kernel**: Vanilla Linux kernel and modules, with a few patches applied
- **Linux LTS Kernel**: Long-term support (LTS) Linux kernel and modules
- **Linux Hardened Kernel**: A security-focused Linux kernel applying a set of hardening patches to mitigate kernel and userspace exploits
- **Linux Realtime Kernel**: All of the kernel is preempted, with the exception of a few very small regions of code ('raw_spinlock critical regions')
- **Linux Realtime LTS Kernel**: Long-term support (LTS) Linux realtime kernel and modules
- **Linux Zen Kernel**: Result of a collaborative effort of kernel hackers to provide the best Linux kernel possible for everyday systems
- **Linux Liquorix Kernel**: Kernel replacement built using Debian-targeted configuration and the Zen kernel sources. Designed for desktop, multimedia, and gaming workloads
- **Linux XanMod Kernel**: Aiming to take full advantage in high-performance workstations, gaming desktops, media centers and others and built to provide a more rock-solid, responsive and smooth desktop experience

In Athena Arch, they can be installed by pacman.

In Athena Nix, they can be set by editing `/etc/nixos/modules/hardware/kernel/default.nix`. Use [Nix Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) to get the correct name of the kernel package name to implement.
