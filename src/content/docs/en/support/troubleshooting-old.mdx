### Installation

#### filesystem `btrfs' doesn't support blocklists

The error during the installation:
```
grub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible.
grub-install: error: filesystem `btrfs' doesn't support blocklists.
```
is caused when the partition table is GPT and you are not using EFI boot mode. If you would like to use GPT, remember to use EFI instead of BIOS/Legacy mode.

#### time warp or clock problem

During the installation of Athena, if you get an error like:
```
gpg: key <keyid> was created 3474 seconds in the future (time warp or clock problem)
```
it can occur when you are installing Athena OS by an ISO that has been released just now. To solve the issue, just wait 30 minutes and boot again by the ISO.

The cause of the issue is due to a key in `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg` that has been generated in a Live Environment that has a different time of the running installer. Since in Live Environment the time changes and fixes to the right time after some minutes, if this change is done during the running of `pacman-key --init`, it causes that error. For example, the Live Environment shows 18:40 and during the install, it switches to 19:40, so the running installer, if creates new key by `pacman-key --init` when the time of Live Environment is switched, it cause the error. If you get this error, boot on Live Environment and, before to run the installer, wait for some minutes that the time clock fixes automatically.

### Boot

#### Restore GRUB

For fixing the GRUB, before exiting from the Live Environment, before proceeding, you must detect the existing Linux partition and the EFI partition containing the GRUB entries for Linux and Windows (or other OS). You can do that by running `sudo fdisk -l`.

Let's guess the existing Linux partition is `/dev/sda3` and the boot efi partition is at `/dev/nvme0n1p1`.

If your existing Linux distribution is based on BTRFS file system, run:
```shell
sudo mount -o subvol=@ /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount -o subvol=@home /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount -o subvol=@log /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
otherwise run:
```shell
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
Then, run:
```shell
mkdir /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount --bind /tmp/intermediate /mnt/boot/efi/

sudo arch-chroot /mnt
```
Now, check the directory tree in `/boot/efi` folder and you should have only these files/directories:
```
'$RECYCLE.BIN'  EFI  'System Volume Information'
```
Check the `EFI`directory and **be sure** that there are not nested further `EFI` directories otherwise your GRUB never work. You must have only the current `EFI` directory with the following files/directories:
```
Boot Microsoft
```
If you see also another `EFI` directory or other ones containing the file `grubx64.efi` (i.e., `GRUB` directory), delete these folders. Note that in other distros, `GRUB` folder could have a different name. Don't worry to delete `GRUB`folder by:
```shell
rm -rf /boot/efi/EFI/GRUB
```
The next command will create it again.

Then run:
```shell
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
```
This command will create the file `/boot/efi/EFI/GRUB/grubx64.efi`.

Finally:
```shell
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
at reboot, be sure that on BIOS the **GRUB** entry has the first priority over Windows Boot Manager. Then, it should work.

Once landed on your working and fixed Linux environment, open the terminal and run:
```shell
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
to restore the Windows entry in GRUB in case it is missing. Reboot the system to check all GRUB entries are working as intended.

:::danger
Don't remove any other files or folders on mounted directories otherwise they will be deleted also on the related device and the boot manager could break.
:::

In case you previously formatted your EFI partition, its UUID could be changed, so, at this point, when you boot, you could get an error and be dropped on the emergency shell:
```
[ TIME ] Timed out waiting for device /dev/disk/by-uuid/0EBF-C0AD.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for File System Check on /dev/disk/by-uuid/0EBF-C0AD.
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for /boot/efi
[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems.
You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type "journalctl -xb" to view system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, or "exit" to continue bootup.
Give root password for maintenance
```
To fix this, boot again by USB to the Athena OS Live Environment and mounting the devices as done before, like:
If your existing Linux distribution is based on BTRFS file system, run:
```shell
sudo mount -o subvol=@ /dev/sda3 /mnt
sudo mount -o subvol=@home /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
sudo mount -o subvol=@log /dev/sda3 /mnt/var/log
```
otherwise run:
```shell
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
```
Then, run:
```shell
mkdir /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /tmp/intermediate
sudo mount --bind /tmp/intermediate /mnt/boot/efi/

sudo arch-chroot /mnt
```
Once you are on chroot environment, run:
```shell
sudo blkid /dev/nvme0n1p1
```
replace `/dev/nvme0n1p1` by your EFI partition device. This command gives you the valid UUID of your EFI partition, for example:
```
/dev/nvme0n1p1: UUID="E856-25BA" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTLABEL="EFI system partition" PARTUUID="71e827d6-2276-46f2-816b-881e51c53d30"
```
Then, you must edit **fstab** to replace the old EFI UUID with this new one. So, open the **fstab** file by:
```shell
nano /etc/fstab
```
and you should get something similar to:
```
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system>             <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
UUID=0EBF-C0AD                            /boot/efi      vfat    umask=0077 0 2
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /              btrfs   subvol=/@,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /home          btrfs   subvol=/@home,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /var/cache     btrfs   subvol=/@cache,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
UUID=f1392ba6-7931-4805-8af1-8fb48bca8f4c /var/log       btrfs   subvol=/@log,noatime,autodefrag,compress=zstd 0 0
```
Replace the **UUID** value of the line containing `/boot/efi` with the one obtained by the `sudo blkid` command above. Save the file, exit from chroot environment by `exit` command, and reboot the system. Again, at reboot, be sure that on BIOS the **GRUB** entry has the first priority over Windows Boot Manager. Then, it should work.

Once landed on your working and fixed Linux environment, open the terminal and run:
```shell
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
to restore the Windows entry in GRUB in case it is missing. Reboot the system to check all GRUB entries are working as intended.

#### Restore Linux and Windows EFI Boot

In case you broke the EFI partition containing Linux and Windows EFI Boot files (assuming they were on the same partition), download a Windows ISO and burn it on a USB key. Then, boot up it. If needed, backup your data.

When you reach the Windows installation environment:
1. select your language and keyboard layout
2. click on **Repair your computer** button
3. click on **Troubleshooting**
4. click on **Command Prompt**
5. run **diskpart**
:::danger
Don't run `CLEAN` command in **DISKPART** otherwise it will soft delete the selected disk! If it occurs, you must recover it by **testdisk** Linux tool.
:::
6. run **list disk** and identify the disk number of the disk containing the Windows EFI Boot partition
7. run **sel disk \<number\>** where *\<number\>* must be replaced with the number of the interested disk
8. run **list part** and identify the partition number of the partition of the selected disk containing the Windows EFI Boot. Usually it is tagged as **System** and it has small size
9. run **sel part \<number\>** where *\<number\>* must be replaced with the number of the interested partition
10. run **delete partition override** to delete the current broken EFI partition
11. run **create part efi size=100** for creating a new EFI partition (the size must be at least 100 MB)
    If you get an error stating:
    ```
    MSR and EFI are Only Supported on the GPT Disk.
    ```
    it means that the disk where you are creating the EFI disk is not GPT. If it is already GPT type, skip to the next step. If not, you need to make it GPT type as follows. Boot on Linux Live Environment by a USB pendrive and use **testdisk** tool. Open the terminal and run:
    ```shell
    testdisk
    ```
    Choose if logging or not. Then select the disk where you will restore the EFI partition:
    ```
    Select a media (use Arrow keys, then press Enter):

    Structure: Ok.  Use Up/Down Arrow keys to select partition.
    Use Left/Right Arrow keys to CHANGE partition characteristics:
                    P=Primary  D=Deleted

    ```
    Now you need to change some of those `D` (Delete) in `P` (Primary) to avoid that during the conversion process your partition is not deleted. To do this, move to the **MS Data** partitions and set them to `P`. Some of them cannot be set as `P`, probably because they are corrupt or other issues but in your case you need only those ones containing your data or have important purposes. To understand this, you can read the information on the last column is present and the size between **Start** and **End** columns, just pick the largest one if the other partitions cannot be set to `P`:

    :::tip
    In case you delete a partition as mistake, don't write any data on your disk. Just use **testdisk** to retrieve your lost partition by selecting the disk containing the lost partition and select **Intel** option (unless you have a different kind of partition). Note that, when you restore lost partitions, testdisk could make your disk as **MBR**, so, in case you need to create in this disk an EFI partition, you must convert the disk as **GPT** as explained above.
    :::
12. run **format fs=fat32 quick** to format the EFI partition as fat32
13. run **assign letter=m**
14. exit
15. Supposing that your Windows installation is installed in **C:**, run **bcdboot c:\windows /s m: /f uefi**
16. If it does not produce error, type **exit** for exiting the Command Prompt and click on **Continue** button for entering to Windows
17. If it produces an error:
  * run **bootrec /fixmbr**
  * run **bootrec /fixboot**
  * run **bootrec /scanos**
  * run **bootrec /rebuildbcd**
  * run **bootsect.exe /nt60 all /force**
18. Exit from the Command Prompt and click on **Startup Repair** button. It should bring you to Windows.

:::note
In case you try to run **bcdedit** on Windows CMD to check the list of Windows Boot Manager entries, and you get an error like **Requested device cannot be found**, be sure your EFI partition is inside a **GPT** disk, otherwise you need to convert it as explained above.
:::
:::note
During the boot of the system, if your BIOS sees multiple **Windows Boot Manager** entries, where only one is working and the other ones are broken, run `efibootmgr` on Linux terminal and identify which entry is bad, and use `efibootmgr -b XXXX --delete-bootnum` to remove it. For example, if you have:
```
BootCurrent: 0001
Timeout: 1 seconds
BootOrder: 0000,0001,0002
Boot0000* Windows Boot Manager	HD(1,GPT,71e827d6-2276-46f2-816b-881e51c53d30,0x800,0x96000)/File(\EFI\MICROSOFT\BOOT\BOOTMGFW.EFI)57494e444f5753000100000088000000780000004200430044004f0042004a004500430054003d007b00390064006500610038003600320063002d0035006300640064002d0034006500370030002d0061006300630031002d006600330032006200330034003400640034003700390035007d0000000c000100000010000000040000007fff0400
Boot0001* GRUB	HD(1,GPT,71e827d6-2276-46f2-816b-881e51c53d30,0x800,0x96000)/File(\EFI\GRUB\GRUBX64.EFI)
Boot0002* Windows Boot Manager	HD(2,GPT,4ae5c801-ebf3-be4c-a9b3-cab7a69f40a8,0xd6800,0x1da5a7f9)/File(\EFI\MICROSOFT\BOOT\BOOTMGFW.EFI)0000424f
```
Assume the bad one is `Boot0002*` entry. In this example with two separated disks, you can see that the assumed good Windows Boot Manager is on HD 1, and the bad one is in HD 2. These entries in general appear because each partition where they are stored maintain `EFI`. It means that a partition of the disk related to HD 2 has this `EFI` folder that you must delete. In general, when you are not sure in which partition this additional `EFI` folder is located, mount each partition and check its content. Of course, be careful to not delete the `EFI` folder inside the partition maintaining the working Windows Boot Manager entry. Finally, after the deletion of rogue `EFI` folder, you can run the command `sudo efibootmgr -b 2 --delete-bootnum`, where `2` is related to the `Boot0002` of the example output above.
:::

Finally, for fixing also the Linux access, burn Athena OS ISO on a USB and follow the steps explained at [Post-installation](/en/installation/install-persistent-usb/#post-installation) section.

#### Several boot entries have been disappeared

In case you are in dual boot and some entries are not shown anymore (i.e., Windows Boot Manager if you have Windows in dual boot), enter in Athena OS and run:
```shell
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
Then reboot.

#### ERROR kdfontop.c:183 put_font_kdfontop: Unable to load such font with such kernel version

The message:
```
setfont: ERROR kdfontop.c:183 put_font_kdfontop: Unable to load such font with such kernel version
```
can be fixed by disabling the deferred takeover by adding `fbcon=nodefer` as kernel parameter in the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable of **/etc/default/grub** file.
Reference: [#99](https://github.com/legionus/kbd/issues/99)

### Display Managers

#### GDM: login background turned to grey

It should be caused by an update of GDM or GNOME packages that restored the default gresource theme file. To restore the Athena GDM theme, run:
```shell
sudo pacman -S athena-gdm-config
```

### Tools

#### Bloodhound

On Bloodhound, when neo4j database is run by `sudo neo4j console`, we can get some errors like:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.LinkageError: Cannot to link java.nio.DirectByteBuffer
```
For solving it, just run neo4j server by `systemctl start neo4j`. You can check the proof that the server is correctly running by `systemctl status neo4j`.

#### Conda

`conda activate` continues to show the prompt **(base)** instead of **(test)**.

The issue is related to the usage of `no-repeat-flag` in `.bashrc`. To solve this, add the following code inside `.bashrc`:
```bash
if [[ $1 != no-repeat-flag  ]]; then

### WSL

#### Win-Kex ESM Mode 'cannot execute: required file not found'
This issue affects both Athena OS and Kali Linux. When you run `kex --esm` and you get:
```
/usr/bin/kex: line 389: /mnt/c/Windows/system32/cmdkey.exe: cannot execute: required file not found
/usr/bin/kex: line 490: /mnt/c/Windows/system32/mstsc.exe: cannot execute: required file not found
```
it could be due to two reasons:
1. wine is installed
2. you are running Athena OS and Kali Linux WSL together

Uninstall wine package, close both the WSL sessions, open CMD in Windows and run `wsl --shutdown`. Run Athena OS and you should not get this error anymore.

#### Win-Kex ESM Mode 'Remote Desktop can't connect'
In case you get the following error:
![Kex ESM RDP error](@assets/images/kex-esm-rdp-error.png)

just open a new Windows terminal and run:
```shell
wsl --shutdown
```
Then, reopen Athena OS WSL and try to run again:
```shell
kex --esm --ip -s
```

### Misc

#### Browser elements overlap

In case it occurs that browser elements can overlap as the following case:
![Website Overlapping](@assets/images/website-overlapping.png)

The reason is that the website is using the Athena OS system font instead of using its one.

In case you would like to solve this behavior on the system side, you need to delete the entry `font-name='JetBrains Mono 11'` set in **/org/gnome/desktop/** or changing its font.
:::caution
If you remove the **font-name** entry, several elements of the desktop (like the top bar) will use the default font. In case you change the font name, the desktop elements will apply it as well.
:::
You can remove it or change the font by:
```shell
dconf dump /org/gnome/desktop/ > fix.txt
```
Edit **fix.txt** and delete the line containing `font-name='JetBrains Mono 11'` or replace this font name with your preferred, save and close the file, then run:
```shell
dconf reset -f /org/gnome/desktop/
cat fix.txt | dconf load /org/gnome/desktop/
```
In case your theme will be reset, just run:
```shell
athena-theme-tweak -t <name of your favourite theme>
```
Use `athena-theme-tweak -l` to get the list of themes to be chosen.

#### Restore system by snapshots in GRUB

In case you are not able to get in the system due to a broken upgrade or similar events, you can leverage on Grub BTRFS snapshots in order to restore a previous state of your system. To do this, run the system, on the GRUB select **Athena OS Snapshots**

![Athena Snapshots](@assets/images/athena-snapshots.png)

Choose the **snapshot** you want to restore

![Athena Snapshots Selection](@assets/images/athena-snapshots-selection.png)

and select the **Linux Kernel** to run

#### Cannot store HTB App Token due to secret-tool hanging

When you run `htb-toolkit -k set` and, by entering your App Token in the Password field secret-tool hangs, try to reboot the system. If it does not work, install Brave browser, open it and at first run a popup window asking for the creation of a new password is shown. You can choose to set a password or just press **Enter** two times if you don't want, and finally try again `htb-toolkit -k set`.
