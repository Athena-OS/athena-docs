#### Bloodhound

On Bloodhound, when neo4j database is run by `sudo neo4j console`, we can get some errors like:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.LinkageError: Cannot to link java.nio.DirectByteBuffer
```
For solving it, just run neo4j server by `systemctl start neo4j`. You can check the proof that the server is correctly running by `systemctl status neo4j`.
