### Pentesting tool from menu opening terminal with no output in VirtualBox

When you search for a pentesting tool, like Nmap, in Application Menu or by Red/Blue Team Menu in GNOME, where the terminal is invoked but with no output, just go to the Virtual Machine settings and disable 3D Acceleration.

### Virtual machine freezes randomly after a while in VMware Workstation Pro 17.x

Uninstall VMware Workstation 17 and [download](https://download3.vmware.com/software/WKST-1625-WIN/VMware-workstation-full-16.2.5-20904516.exe) from [VMware website](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_pro/16_0).

Then, open VMware Workstation, right-click on the virtual machine object -> Manage -> Change Hardware Compatibility... and select **Workstation 16.x**, on the next windows select **Alter this virtual machine**, apply these changes and run the virtual machine.
