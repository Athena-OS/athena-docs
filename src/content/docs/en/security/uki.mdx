A **Unified Kernel Image (UKI)** is a single, signed EFI executable that contains all components needed to boot Linux securely under **UEFI**, **Secure Boot**, and **TPM** environments.

Athena OS builds and uses UKIs for each installed kernel (LTS and Hardened) to guarantee **measurable integrity** and **tamper-proof booting**.

## What is inside a UKI?

A UKI bundles these components into one signed `.efi` file:

| Component | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **EFI Stub** | Small loader that allows the image to be directly executed by UEFI firmware |
| **Linux Kernel** | The main kernel binary |
| **Initramfs** | Early userspace environment for mounting the root filesystem |
| **Kernel Command Line** | Static boot parameters, embedded in the image |
| **Metadata Section** | Optional signature, OS release information, and PCR policy data |

All of these are **cryptographically signed** and **measured** by Secure Boot and TPM at startup.

## Why UKI is More Secure

### 1. All-in-One Signed Artifact
Traditional boot setups load multiple files (bootloader → kernel → initramfs), each potentially modifiable.
With UKI, the **kernel, initramfs, and parameters are unified and signed together**.

Tampering with *any* component invalidates the entire signature.

### 2. Seamless Secure Boot Integration
Because a UKI is a standalone EFI executable, it is directly validated by **UEFI Secure Boot**.

This eliminates risks from:
- Unsigned kernel/initramfs mismatches
- Modified kernel command lines
- Malicious injected initramfs content

### 3. TPM Measurement and Binding
Each UKI is measured into **PCR11**, **PCR12**, and **PCR13** by **systemd-stub**, creating an attestation trail.
When used with **LUKS + TPM**, this ensures:
- The TPM will only unseal secrets if the measured UKI matches the enrolled trusted state.
- Any modification in kernel, parameters, or initramfs will invalidate the PCRs.

### 4. Reproducibility & Rollback Protection
Every UKI is reproducible from deterministic build metadata.  
Versioned entries in `/boot/loader/entries/` ensure that updates create new signed UKIs, leaving older ones intact for rollback.

### 5. Simplified Boot Flow
No external bootloader scripting or initramfs juggling, the firmware directly executes the UKI:
```
UEFI → systemd-boot → UKI (kernel+initramfs+cmdline)
```

This reduces attack vectors and improves reliability.

## UKIs in Athena OS

Athena OS automatically generates and signs UKIs during kernel installation and updates.  
For example:

| Entry | Kernel | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| **Athena OS (LTS)** | Linux LTS | Stable, long-term kernel for compatibility and pentesting |
| **Athena OS (Hardened)** | Linux Hardened | Extra protections for high-security environments |

Each entry corresponds to a UKI file stored in:
```
/efi/EFI/Linux/athena-lts.efi
/efi/EFI/Linux/athena-hardened.efi
```
These are automatically signed with the same MOK keys used by **Secure Boot** and measured by the **TPM**.
