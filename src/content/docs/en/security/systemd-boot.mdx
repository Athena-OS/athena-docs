Athena OS replaces **GRUB** with **systemd-boot** as the default boot manager to enhance **security**, **simplicity**, and **tight integration** with modern Linux technologies like [Secure Boot](/en/installation/secureboot/), [TPM](/en/installation/tpm/), and [Unified Kernel Images (UKI)](/en/installation/uki/).

## Why systemd-boot?

Unlike GRUB, which is a large, insecure and scriptable bootloader supporting legacy BIOS environments and complex configurations, **systemd-boot** is a **minimalistic EFI boot manager** that works exclusively on modern **UEFI systems**. It directly loads EFI executables (like signed UKIs) from the EFI System Partition.

### Advantages over GRUB

| Feature | GRUB | systemd-boot |
| -------- | ---- | ------------- |
| Complexity | High (shell, modules, scripting) | Minimal and deterministic |
| UEFI Support | Partial / optional | Native |
| Secure Boot | Requires shim or manual signing | Direct signing, fully UEFI-compliant |
| TPM / Measured Boot | Limited support | Native integration with PCR11, PCR12, PCR13 via systemd-stub |
| UKI (Unified Kernel Image) | Not supported | First-class support |
| Speed | Slower (multiple stages) | Very fast (single EFI load) |
| Configuration | grub.cfg scripts | Simple text files in `/boot/loader/entries/` |

## Security Advantages

### 1. Smaller Attack Surface
systemd-boot has a minimal codebase, no scripting engine, and no legacy BIOS compatibility layer.  
This drastically reduces the risk of **code injection**, **buffer overflows**, or **malicious configuration tampering**.

### 2. Directly Verifiable EFI Executables
Each boot entry in systemd-boot points directly to a **signed EFI image** (usually a UKI).  
These files can be authenticated by **Secure Boot** and measured into the **TPM** at boot.

### 3. Integrated with Secure Boot and TPM
systemd-boot works seamlessly with **Secure Boot**, **Measured Boot**, and **TPM-bound encryption**.  
Because it uses **systemd-stub**, every kernel image is:
- Verified by Secure Boot.
- Measured into PCR11 (and related registers).
- Capable of proving integrity before decryption keys are released.

### 4. Native Support for Unified Kernel Images
Unlike GRUB, which loads a kernel and initramfs separately, systemd-boot loads a single **UKI** (Unified Kernel Image), a self-contained, signed EFI file that includes:
- The kernel
- The initramfs
- The kernel command line

This integration eliminates configuration drift and makes verification simple and reproducible.

## Athena OS Boot Options

When Athena OS boots, the user is offered two main entries:

### **Athena OS LTS**
Uses the **Linux LTS kernel**, providing maximum **stability** and compatibility with **pentesting tools** requiring low-level kernel access or custom modules.

Ideal for:
- Daily use
- Tools that interact deeply with the network stack or kernel memory

### **Athena OS Hardened**
Uses the **Linux Hardened kernel**, which applies additional hardening measures such as:
- Stronger kernel memory protections (KSPP patches)
- Syscall filtering and exploit mitigations
- Reduced kernel attack surface
- Enhanced Spectre/Meltdown mitigations

This mode is recommended when performing operations in **untrusted environments** or handling **sensitive data**.

:::tip
The Hardened kernel ensures a security-first environment.  
However, some low-level pentesting tools may not function correctly due to restricted kernel hooks.
