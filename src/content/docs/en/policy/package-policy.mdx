As an open-source operating system, Athena OS does not have a specific Package Policy that governs the inclusion or management of packages in the distribution. Athena OS follows a community-driven model where users contribute to the package repository and maintain packages.

Athena OS uses a package management system based on Pacman and Nix, which are responsible for handling the management of software packages on the system. The Arch and Nix communities maintain the Arch-related and Nixpkgs repositories, where users can contribute and share packages that are not still part of the repositories.

While there is no formal Package Policy document, the Athena OS community adheres to certain guidelines and best practices when maintaining packages:

* Arch Packaging Standards: The Arch Linux community has defined packaging standards, including the [Arch Packaging Standards (APS)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_package_guidelines), which outline guidelines for creating and maintaining packages in the Arch Linux ecosystem. These standards ensure consistency and compatibility within the Arch Linux package repository.
* Upstream Sources: Packages in the repositories used by Athena OS should be sourced from upstream projects or directly from trusted sources. This ensures that packages are obtained from reliable and verified sources to maintain their integrity.
* Versioning and Updates: Package maintainers are responsible for keeping packages up to date with the latest stable versions and security patches. Regular updates are provided to ensure that users have access to the most recent software versions.
* Community Involvement: The Athena OS community encourages community involvement in maintaining packages and reporting issues. Users are encouraged to participate in discussions, report bugs, and contribute to package maintenance to improve the overall quality of the distribution.

Nix Community distributes several guidelines for packaging on the official Nix repository and the Athena OS community adheres to these guidelines and best practices when maintaining packages. By adhering to these guidelines, it is possible to guarantee the compatibility, stability, and security of your Athena OS system.

While there is no specific Package Policy document for Athena OS, it is important to follow the guidelines and best practices set by the Arch Linux and Nix communities when contributing, maintaining, or installing packages. By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure the compatibility, stability, and security of your Athena OS system.
