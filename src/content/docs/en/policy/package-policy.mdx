As an open-source operating system, Athena OS does not have a specific Package Policy that governs the inclusion or management of packages in the distribution. Athena OS follows a community-driven model where users contribute to the package repository and maintain packages.

Athena OS uses a package management system based on Nix, which is responsible for handling the management of software packages on the system. The Nix community maintains the Nixpkgs Repository, where users can contribute and share packages that are not still part of the repository.

Nix Community distributes several guidelines for packaging on the official Nix repository and the Athena OS community adheres to these guidelines and best practices when maintaining packages. By adhering to these guidelines, it is possible to guarantee the compatibility, stability, and security of your Athena OS system.
