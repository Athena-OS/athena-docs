Athena OS is a community-driven project that focuses on providing a lightweight and customizable Linux distribution.

Athena OS does not collect personal information about users by default. However, it's important to note that, when you use Athena OS, you may install various software packages, tools, or applications that have their own privacy policies. These policies are specific to the respective software and not directly related to Athena OS itself.

When installing software on Athena OS, it's crucial to review the privacy policies of individual applications or services that you use or interact with. This is especially important for any third-party applications or services you install on top of the Athena OS distribution.
