[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

In Athena OS, Hyprland is inspired on the wonderful work of [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

At any time you can choose to customize the current environment or to use a different theme.

## Customize Environment

Hyprland leverages on several files for applying its current theme. These files are distributed mainly between:
* **~/.config/hypr**: containing all Hyprland configuration files (as keybindings, startup applications, background)
* **~/.config/eww**: containing all eww configuration files (as top bar, OSettings, ONotify)
* **~/.local/bin**: containing binaries used for this theme
* **~/.local/share**: containing icon theme and font

Files in **~/.config/hypr** that you can customize are:
* **env.conf**: define environment variables to be used in Hyprland
* **execs.conf**: define the processes to start at Hyprland startup
* **keybindings.conf**: define the keybindings for launching applications and actions
* **hyprland.conf**: define several settings for Hyprland environment and invoke the previous configuration files above

Customize them according to your needs.
