[Hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland) is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

In Athena OS, Hyprland is inspired on the wonderful work of [@end-4](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).

At any time you can choose to customize the current environment or to use a different theme.

## Customize Environment

Hyprland leverages on several files for applying its current theme. These files are distributed mainly between:
* **~/.config/hypr**: containing all Hyprland configuration files (as keybindings, startup applications, background)
* **~/.config/eww**: containing all eww configuration files (as top bar, OSettings, ONotify)
* **~/.local/bin**: containing binaries used for this theme
* **~/.local/share**: containing icon theme and font

Files in **~/.config/hypr** that you can customize are:
* **env.conf**: define environment variables to be used in Hyprland
* **execs.conf**: define the processes to start at Hyprland startup
* **keybindings.conf**: define the keybindings for launching applications and actions
* **hyprland.conf**: define several settings for Hyprland environment and invoke the previous configuration files above

Customize them according to your needs.

If you wish to change the Desktop background, rename your image as **wallpaper** and just replace **~/.config/eww/images/wallpaper/wallpaper** by your image file.

## Customize Theme

If you would like to change the entire theme of Hyprland and applying a different one, you need to search for different. Usually, Hyprland themes are distributed as **dotfiles**. Dotfiles are named in this manner because they are the usual folder in your home directory that start with **.** in their name. So, a Hyprland theme typically consists of a **.config** and **.local** folders, but they could have also more of them.

For applying an Hyprland theme, you must copy the content of these folders in the related **dot folders** inside your home directory. If there is no error in Hyprland configuration, the theme should be applied automatically.
