I you wish to change some GNOME elements in Athena OS, you can follow this guide to get the right steps and transform Athena according to your taste.

GNOME is composed of several resources and we will discuss each one of them in order to tweak it as possible.

## Customize Background

Backgrounds are stored in `/usr/share/backgrounds/default/` folder.

If you wish to change only the background, you can do it by different ways.

The first one is to go to the top-right **power button** -> **gear icon** -> the Settings window appears -> **Appearance** -> click on **Add Picture...** and select your favourite background.

Here you can change also if applying a light or dark theme.

Another method is to use **GNOME Tweaks**. Go to the **App Grid** or press **Super** key two times, and search for **GNOME Tweaks** or **Tweaks**, usually it is inside the **Utilities** group and launch it.

When the GNOME Tweaks is opened, move to **Appearance** tab and tweak your image and its adjustment under the **Background** section.

An additional method is by terminal. Run:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri-dark background.png
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options stretched
```
**stretched** is used to adjust the image in order to fill the entire screen.

:::tip
If you are using a dark theme, use **picture-uri-dark**. If you are using a light theme, replace **picture-uri-dark** by **picture-uri** parameter.
