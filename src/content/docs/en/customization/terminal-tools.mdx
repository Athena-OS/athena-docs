## VIM

The [Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) configuration has been used on Athena OS for Vim. It implements smart and useful [plugins](https://github.com/amix/vimrc#included-plugins), [color schemes](https://github.com/amix/vimrc#included-color-schemes) and [modes](https://github.com/amix/vimrc#included-modes). If you would like to customize it, you can search for similar projects on GitHub or GitLab.

## Neofetch

Settings of [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) can be accessed on `.config/neofetch/config.conf`. You can change the shown ASCII logo and the output system information. For example, for changing logo, open `config.conf` file and search for `ascii_distro` string. There, you can change its value with one of the list above that file section.

## Tmux

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is implemented with several plugins retrieved from [Tmux Powerline Theme](https://github.com/wfxr/tmux-power). [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) is used to manage the plugins.
