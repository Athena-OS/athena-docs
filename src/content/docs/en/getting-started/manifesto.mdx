<h1>The Aegis of Noctua</h1>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another night I wish to be immersed in the darkness, staring into the void. 

But I can't remain there forever. Each day brings its share of tragedy. Wars, murders, road accidents, workplace deaths. It's all become a statistic, just a way to push away the thought of death.

The world is steeped in indifference, selfishness, and superficiality, lived by humans hypnotized by their smartphones, obsessed with eroding their privacy in the name of a fleeting moment of fame.

Through this indifference passes the perpetual cry of a father for his children, victims of political schemes they never asked to be part of.
Through this cursed indifference walks, unseen, a long line of ghosts, children whose rights to life was violently torn away, victims of slavery and the worst human perversions.

*Democratia... nomen inane*

Democracy... you are but a word, now shaped by algorithms, surveillance capitalism, and unbridled digitalization. You stand limping, supported by the interests of a few, blind to the rights of many.

In this chaotic twist, we live invisibly, between electric impulses and radio waves, in a dimension whose surface is a jumble of things meant to polarize people. Beneath that surface, there's us and the worst scums.

We will be filled with courage, audacity and rebellion by the tears of the victims.

We are pervaded by the beauty of codes, circuits, wires, screens, and the magnificence of nature and Universe.

Our action must be conceived as an assault against the forces that threaten the innocent, to make them bow before mankind.

Labels no longer matter. "Hacker" is just a name. What is important are the pillars that support your ideal:
<br />
<br />
**Knowledge is the Foundation of Power**

Knowledge is dangerous in the wrong hands. That's why what we do, what you do, requires more than just skill. It requires judgment, discipline, and the willingness to ask hard questions of yourself.
<br />
**The Responsibility We Carry**

We are not just users; we are guardians. What we do matters, not just for us, but for the countless people who rely on digital systems we touch.
<br />
**The Fight for Freedom**

Freedom doesn't just happen, it's something we fight for, something we earn. It's in the systems we build, the codes we write, and the choices we make every single day.
<br />
**Collaboration and Resilience**

Together, we're stronger, smarter, and more resilient.
<br />
**A Call to Action**

Learn. Protect. Challenge the forces that seek to control and exploit us. But most importantly: act responsibly. The stakes are high, and the line between good and harm is thinner than ever.
<br />
<br />
From here we launch this **Manifesto** of overwhelming and incendiary force, upon which our will is founded, because we seek to free this world from its plague.

Carry this spirit with you: to defend the right to life, to knowledge, and to freedom for every human being.
