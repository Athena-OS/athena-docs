## Win-KeX

**Win-KeX** allows you to enjoy a GUI experience on Athena OS. It is based on Kali Linux Win-KeX adapted for systemd. You can work in three modes:
* **Window mode**: start a Athena OS desktop in a dedicated window
* **Enhanced session mode**: use RDP for a more feature rich experience
* **Seamless mode**: share the Windows desktop between Windows and Athena XFCE application and menus

### Window Mode
