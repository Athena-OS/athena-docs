Athena hacking tool surface mainly leverages on Athena and Nixpkgs repositories.

Athena OS retrieves all the pentesting tools through [BlackArch repository](https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch/). Its repository contains 2800+ tools, classified for categories. You can install tools individually or in groups according to the categories they belong.

[Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) is the official Nix repository containing all the pentesting tools deployed by the community for Nix-based systems.

Hacking tools can be installed and used in several ways by:
* Single tools
* Cyber Security roles
* Red Team menu
* Categories

### Single tools

For installing a single tool, in Athena Arch you can simply run `sudo pacman -S <tool-name>` while in Athena Nix you can simply declare it inside `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` or run it in an ephimeral environment by `nix-shell -p <tool-name>`.

### Cyber Security roles

Cyber Security roles allow to install hacking tools according to a specific role. Each one of these roles is linked to a package that is installed according to the following table:

| Role | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| 💙 Blue Teamer 💙 | cyber-toolkit blue |
| 🐞 Bug Bounty Hunter 🐞 | cyber-toolkit bountyhunter |
| 🍘 Cracker Specialist 🍘 | cyber-toolkit cracker |
| 💀 DoS Tester 💀 | cyber-toolkit dos |
| 🎓 Enthusiast Student 🎓 | cyber-toolkit student |
| 🔍 Forensic Analyst 🔍 | cyber-toolkit forensic |
| 🦠 Malware Analyst 🦠 | cyber-toolkit malware |
| 📱 Mobile Analyst 📱 | cyber-toolkit mobile |
| 🌐 Network Analyst 🌐 | cyber-toolkit network |
| 🕵️ OSINT Specialist 🕵️ | cyber-toolkit osint |
| ❤️ Red Teamer ❤️ | cyber-toolkit red |
| 🕸️ Web Pentester 🕸️ | cyber-toolkit web |

:::note
`cyber-toolkit` needs `sudo` to run.
:::

The list of tools for each role can be accessed and edited in `/usr/share/cyber-toolkit/roles`.

In Athena Nix, these roles are deployed by `/etc/nixos/modules/cyber` module and the user can customize it as desired.

Inside the role module files, the user can see what are the specific tools installed for each role.

You can set your Cyber Security role as described [here](/en/resources/athena-welcome/#cyber-security-roles).

In Athena Arch, you can set more than one role, Athena Welcome will keep the latest set role. During the download of packages for a role, in case the process is interrupted, don't worry, you don't need to download from scratch because the downloaded packages are temporarily saved in pacman cache.

In Athena Nix, to set more than one role, it is needed to manually edit `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and add a further line invoking the second role Nix module.

### Red Team menu

Athena OS GNOME uses Red Team menu for accessing to the main hacking tools. It is better described in detail [here](/en/resources/redteam-menu/).

### Categories

By using BlackArch repository, Athena Arch can install packages by cyber security categories deployed as package group that users can install by `sudo pacman -S <category>`:

### Issues

In Athena Nix, during the installation of a role, if you get an error that interrupts the process, detect what is the tool package is producing the error, edit `/etc/nixos/modules/roles/<your-role>/default.nix` and comment or delete the line containing the tool package name and reinstall the role.
