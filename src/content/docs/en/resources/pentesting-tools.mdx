Athena hacking tool surface mainly leverages on Nixpkgs repository.

[Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/) is the official Nix repository containing also all the pentesting tools deployed by the community.

Hacking tools can be installed and used in several ways by:
* Single tools
* Cyber Security roles
* Red Team menu
* Categories

### Single tools

For installing a single tool, you can simply declare it inside `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` or run it in an ephimeral environment by `nix-shell -p <tool-name>`.

### Cyber Security roles

Cyber Security roles allow to install hacking tools according to a specific role. Each one of these roles is linked to a package that is installed according to the following table:

| Role | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| 💙 Blue Teamer 💙 | cyber-toolkit blue |
| 🐞 Bug Bounty Hunter 🐞 | cyber-toolkit bounty |
| 🍘 Cracker Specialist 🍘 | cyber-toolkit cracker |
| 💀 DoS Tester 💀 | cyber-toolkit dos |
| 🎓 Enthusiast Student 🎓 | cyber-toolkit student |
| 🔍 Forensic Analyst 🔍 | cyber-toolkit forensic |
| 🦠 Malware Analyst 🦠 | cyber-toolkit malware |
| 📱 Mobile Analyst 📱 | cyber-toolkit mobile |
| 🌐 Network Analyst 🌐 | cyber-toolkit network |
| 🕵️ OSINT Specialist 🕵️ | cyber-toolkit osint |
| ❤️ Red Teamer ❤️ | cyber-toolkit red |
| 🕸️ Web Pentester 🕸️ | cyber-toolkit web |

:::note
`cyber-toolkit` needs `sudo` to run.
:::

These roles are deployed by `/etc/nixos/modules/roles` modules and the user can customize them as desired.

Inside the role module files, the user can see what are the specific tools installed for each role.

You can set your Cyber Security role as described [here](/en/resources/athena-welcome/#cyber-security-roles).

To set more than one role, it is needed to manually edit `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` and add a further line invoking the second role Nix module.

### Red Team menu

Athena OS GNOME uses Red Team menu for accessing to the main hacking tools. It is better described in detail [here](/en/resources/redteam-menu/).

### Issues

During the installation of a role, if you get an error that interrupts the process, detect what is the tool package is producing the error, edit `/etc/nixos/modules/roles/<your-role>/default.nix` and comment or delete the line containing the tool package name and reinstall the role.
