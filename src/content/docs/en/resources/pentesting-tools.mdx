Athena hacking tool surface mainly leverages on BlackArch repository.

[BlackArch Linux](https://blackarch.org/) is an Arch-based Linux pentesting distribution for penetration testers and security researchers. Its repository contains [2800+ tools](https://blackarch.org/tools.html), classified for categories. You can install tools individually or in groups according to the categories they belong. BlackArch Repository is compatible with only Arch-based distributions as Athena OS.

Hacking tools can be installed and used in several ways by:
* Single tools
* Cyber Security roles
* Red Team menu
* Categories

### Single tools

For installing a single tool, you can simply run `sudo pacman -S <tool-name>`.

### Cyber Security roles

Cyber Security roles allow to install hacking tools according to a specific role. Each one of these roles is linked to a package that is installed according to the following table:

| Role | Package |
| ---- | ------- |
| 💙 Blue Teamer 💙 | athena-blueteamer |
| 🐞 Bug Bounty Hunter 🐞 | athena-bountyhunter |
| 🍘 Cracker Specialist 🍘 | athena-cracker |
| 💀 DoS Tester 💀 | athena-dos |
| 🎓 Enthusiast Student 🎓 | athena-student |
| 🔍 Forensic Analyst 🔍 | athena-forensic |
| 🦠 Malware Analyst 🦠 | athena-malware |
| 📱 Mobile Analyst 📱 | athena-mobile |
| 🌐 Network Analyst 🌐 | athena-network |
| 🕵️ OSINT Specialist 🕵️ | athena-osint |
| ❤️ Red Teamer ❤️ | athena-redteamer |
| 🕸️ Web Pentester 🕸️ | athena-webpentester |

These packages are created as metapackages and they are checked carefully in order to prevent any conflicts among dependencies.

Since the packages inside each role could evolve frequently, reporting all tools on a document could not be efficient. If you wish to know what are the tools for each role, you can use two methods:
1. opening **Athena Welcome** and click on **Show Tools for Roles** button
   * you can filter the roles by the button on the bottom side
     ![Athena Welcome Role Tools](@assets/images/athena-welcome-roletools.png)
2. running `pacman -Sii <role-package> | grep -Po '^Depends On\s*: \K.+' | head -1`
   * where `<role-package>` should be replaced by the package of a role, for example `athena-redteamer`.

You can set your Cyber Security role as described [here](/en/resources/athena-welcome/#cyber-security-roles).

You can set more than one role, Athena Welcome will keep the latest set role.

During the download of packages for a role, in case the process is interrupted, don't worry, you don't need to download from scratch because the downloaded packages are temporarily saved in pacman cache.

### Red Team menu

Athena OS GNOME uses Red Team menu for accessing to the main hacking tools. It is better described in detail [here](/en/resources/redteam-menu/).

### Categories
