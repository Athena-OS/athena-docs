[Athena Cyber Hub (ACH)](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-cyber-hub) is a forked version of [Vanilla Control Center](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/vanilla-control-center) with several differences in order to fit the needs of Cyber Security users on Athena OS.
It is intended to run vulnerable laboratories for learning purposes and cyber security platforms for offensive and defensive activities.

## Usage
**Athena OS Cyber Hub** can be run by clicking its icon in the Application List or running `athena-cyber-hub` in the terminal.

It provides three sections:
* Cyber Platform Center
* Vulnerability Lab
* Cyber Lab

#### Cyber Platform Center
It offers a set of **Cyber Security platforms** used for several purposes (i.e., defensive), as [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) and [GreenBone](https://github.com/greenbone/) tools.

#### Vulnerability Lab
It contains several **CVE laboratories** from [Vulhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) where you can train on **real CVEs** to exploit technologies and services. Furthermore, it provides also several OWASP machines to enjoy with. Run your favourite vulnerable environment and get your CVE!

#### Cyber Lab
Set your **custom containers** and manage them in a centralized manner! When ACH is run for the first time, it will create `~/.config/athena-cyber-hub/cyberlab.toml` configuration file. Edit it by inserting the required information about your container, and then run ACH. Your containers will be collected in Cyber Lab section.

Example configuration file:
```toml
[[environment]]
id = "vulhub/activemq"
name = "ActiveHello"
path_docker = "/usr/share/athena-platform-center/vulhub/activemq/CVE-2015-5254/docker-compose.yml"
path_readme = "/usr/share/athena-platform-center/vulhub/activemq/CVE-2015-5254/README.md"

[[environment]]
id = "well-hub/yourlab"
name = "Container 2"
path_docker = "/path/to/docker-compose.yml"
path_readme = "/path/to/README.md"
```
