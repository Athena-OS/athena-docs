[NIST Feed](https://github.com/D3vil0p3r/NIST-Feed) is a special tool able to retrieve information about **existing CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** and **inform** you about a **new published** or **updated CVE** by a popup notification by connecting to the [NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)!

The notification contains a description of the CVE. When the popup notification is shown, users can left-click on it for accessing to the NIST NVD page with all detailed information, or right-click for closing it.

A sample of enabled popup notification is the following

An output sample on retrieving information about an existing CVE by terminal is the following:
```

NIST Feed can be configured according to the parameters shown by `nist-feed -h` command. Users can decide which kind of CVE they wish to be informed about, for instance CVEs with a high impact on the confidentiality and integrity, or CRITICAL CVEs. Some examples:
* Set Desktop Notifications for latest or updated CVE with CRITICAL severity:
  ```shell
  nist-feed -n -l -s CRITICAL
  ```
* Show details about the last three CVEs. No Desktop Notifications:
  ```shell
  nist-feed -r 3
  ```
* Show details about the last twenty CVEs with PHYSICAL as attack vector and MEDIUM severity. No Desktop Notifications:
  ```shell
  nist-feed -V AV:P -s MEDIUM
  ```
* Set Desktop Notifications for latest or updated CVE having high Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact:
  ```shell
  nist-feed -n -l -m C:H/I:H/A:H
  ```
  or
  ```shell
  nist-feed -n -l -c C:H -i I:H -a A:H
  ```
* Set Desktop Notifications for latest or updated CVE with HIGH attack complexity and NETWORK as attack vector:
  ```shell
  nist-feed -n -l -A AC:H -V AV:N
  ```

The `-s` argument is used for setting a scheduled popup notification on crontab according to the specified filters.
