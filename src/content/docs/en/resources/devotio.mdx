[Devotio](https://github.com/Athena-OS/devotio) is a secure disk erasure tool based on **DoD 5220.22 M**, **ATA Secure Erase** and **encryption-based destruction**.

It allows to select the specific device to erase or every disk on your system. It involves:
* HDD
* SSD
* LUKS
* USB
* RAM
* Zram
* Swap

## Usage

Devotio is included in Athena OS Live ISO. You can use Devotio to erase devices also on other operating systems.

You can burn it on a device and land on Athena OS Live Environment. Then, run:
```shell
sudo devotio
```
and choose secure erasing between a specific disk or all devices.

A test on a virtual machine HDD sized of 50 GB needed 19 minutes for secure erasing.
